                       //6\nout.println(response);                                    //7\n}                                                        //8\n1.ServerSocket 创建并监听端口的连接请求\n2.accept() 调用阻塞，直到一个连接被建立了。返回一个新的 Socket 用来处理 客户端和服务端的交互\n3.流被创建用于处理 socket 的输入和输出数据。BufferedReader 读取从字符输入流里面的本文。PrintWriter 打印格式化展示的对象读到本文输出流\n4.处理循环开始 readLine() 阻塞，读取字符串直到最后是换行或者输入终止。\n5.如果客户端发送的是“Done”处理循环退出\n6.执行方法处理请求，返回服务器的响应\n7.响应发回客户端\n8.处理循环继续\n显然，这段代码限制每次只能处理一个连接。为了实现多个并行的客户端我们需要分配一个新的 Thread 给每个新的客户端 Socket(当然需要更多的代码)。但考虑使用这种方法来支持大量的同步，长连接。在任何时间点多线程可能处于休眠状态，等待输入或输出数据。这很容易使得资源的大量浪费，对性能产生负面影响。当然，有一种替代方案。\n除了示例中所示阻塞调用，原生 socket 库同时也包含了非阻塞 I/O 的功能。这使我们能够确定任何一个 socket 中是否有数据准备读或写。我们还可以设置标志，因为读/写调用如果没有数据立即返回；就是说，如果一个阻塞被调用后就会一直阻塞，直到处理完成。通过这种方法，会带来更大的代码的复杂性成本，其实我们可以获得更多的控制权来如何利用网络资源。\nJAVA NIO\n在 2002 年，Java 1.4 引入了非阻塞 API 在 java.nio 包（NIO）。\n\"New\"还是\"Nonblocking\"?\nNIO 最初是为 New Input/Output 的缩写。然而，Java 的 API 已经存在足够长的时间，它不再是新的。现在普遍使用的缩写来表示Nonblocking I/O (非阻塞 I/O)。另一方面，一般（包括作者）指阻塞 I/O 为 OIO 或 Old\nInput/Output。你也可能会遇到普通 I/O。\n我们已经展示了在 Java 的 I/O 阻塞一例例子。图 1.1 展示了方法\n必须扩大到处理多个连接：给每个连接创建一个线程，有些连接是空闲的！显然，这种方法的可扩展性将是受限于可以在 JVM 中创建的线程数。\nFigure 1.1 Blocking I/O\n\n当你的应用中连接数比较少，这个方案还是可以接受。当并发连接超过10000 时，context-switching（上下文切换）开销将是明显的。此外，每个线程都有一个默认的堆栈内存分配了 128K 和 1M 之间的空间。考虑到整体的内存和操作系统需要处理 100000 个或更多的并发连接资源，这似乎是一个不理想的解决方案。\nSELECTOR\n相比之下，图1.2 显示了使用非阻塞I/O，主要是消除了这些方法\n约束。在这里，我们介绍了“Selector”，这是 Java 的无阻塞 I/O 实现的关键。\nFigure 1.2 Nonblocking I/O\n\nSelector 最终决定哪一组注册的 socket 准备执行 I/O。正如我们之前所解释的那样，这 I/O 操作设置为非阻塞模式。通过通知，一个线程可以同时处理多个并发连接。（一个 Selector 由一个线程通常处理，但具体实施可以使用多个线程。）因此，每次读或写操作执行能立即检查完成。总体而言，该模型提供了比 阻塞 I/O 模型 更好的资源使用，因为\n\n可以用较少的线程处理更多连接，这意味着更少的开销在内存和上下文切换上\n当没有 I/O 处理时，线程可以被重定向到其他任务上。\n\n你可以直接用这些 Java API 构建的 NIO 建立你的应用程序，但这样做\n正确和安全是无法保证的。实现可靠和可扩展的 event-processing（事件处理器）来处理和调度数据并保证尽可能有效地，这是一个繁琐和容易出错的任务，最好留给专家 - Netty。\n"},"GETTING STARTED/Introducing Netty.html":{"url":"GETTING STARTED/Introducing Netty.html","title":"Netty 介绍","keywords":"","body":"Netty 介绍\n一个应用想要支持成千上万并发的客户端，在以前，这样的想法会被认为是荒谬。而在今天，我们认为这是理所当然的。事实上，开发者知道，总是会有这样的需求——以较低的成本交付来换取更大的吞吐量和可用性。\n我们不要低估最后一点的重要性。我们从漫长的痛苦的经验学习到，低级别的 API 不仅暴露了高级别直接使用的复杂性，而且引入了过分依赖于这项技术所造成的短板。因此，面向对象的一个基本原则：通过抽象来隐藏背后的复杂性。\n这一原则已见成效，框架的形式封装解决方案成为了常见的编程任务，他们中有许多典型的分布式系统。现在大多数专业的 Java 开发人员都熟悉一个或多个这些框架（比如 Spring），并且许多已成为不可或缺的，使他们能够满足他们的技术要求以及他们的计划。\n谁在用 Netty\nNetty 是一个广泛使用的 Java 网络编程框架（Netty 在 2011 年获得了Duke's Choice Award，见https://www.java.net/dukeschoice/2011）。它活跃和成长于用户社区，像大型公司 Facebook 和 Instagram 以及流行\n开源项目如 Infinispan, HornetQ, Vert.x, Apache Cassandra 和 Elasticsearch 等，都利用其强大的对于网络抽象的核心代码。\n反过来，Netty 也从这些开源项目中获益。随着这些项目的作用，Netty 也不断提高了其应用的范围和灵活性，比如已经实现了的协议就有 FTP, SMTP, HTTP, WebSocket 和 SPDY 以及其他二进制和基于文本的协议。\n在初创公司中 Firebase 和 Urban Airship 在使用 Netty。前者 Firebase 是使用 long-lived HTTP 连接，后者是使用 各种推送通知。\n当你使用 Twitter,你会使用 Finagle,这个是基于 Netty API 提供给内部系统通讯。Facebook 使用 Netty 来提供于 Nifty 类似的功能 Apache Thrift 服务。这些公司可扩展性和高性能的表现得益于 Netty 的贡献。\n这些例子的真实案例会在后面几章讲到。\n2011 年 Netty 项目从 Red Hat 独立开来从而让广泛的开发者社区贡献者参与进来。Red Hat ，Twitter 继续使用 Netty ,并且成为保持其最活跃的贡献者之一。\n下面展示了 Netty 技术和方法的特点\n\n设计\n针对多种传输类型的统一接口 - 阻塞和非阻塞\n简单但更强大的线程模型\n真正的无连接的数据报套接字支持\n链接逻辑支持复用\n\n\n易用性\n大量的 Javadoc 和 代码实例\n除了在 JDK 1.6 + 额外的限制。（一些特征是只支持在Java\n1.7 +。可选的功能可能有额外的限制。）\n\n\n性能\n比核心 Java API 更好的吞吐量，较低的延时\n资源消耗更少，这个得益于共享池和重用\n减少内存拷贝 \n\n\n健壮性 \n消除由于慢，快，或重载连接产生的 OutOfMemoryError\n消除经常发现在 NIO 在高速网络中的应用中的不公平的读/写比\n\n\n安全\n完整的 SSL / TLS 和 StartTLS 的支持\n运行在受限的环境例如 Applet 或 OSGI\n\n\n社区\n发布的更早和更频繁\n社区驱动\n\n\n\n异步和事件驱动\n所有的网络应用程序需要被设计为可扩展性，可以被界定为“一个系统，网络能力，或过程中能够处理越来越多的工作方式或可扩大到容纳增长的能力”（见 Bondi, André B. (2000). \"Characteristics of scalability and their impact on performance\"）。我们已经说过，Netty 帮助您利用非阻塞 I/O 完成这一目标，通常称为“异步 I/O”\n我们将使用“异步”和其同源词在这本书中大量的使用，所以这是介绍他们的一个很好的时候。异步，即非同步事件，当然是跟你日常生活的类似。例如，您可以发送电子邮件；可能得到或者得不到任何回应，或者当你发送一个您可能会收到一个消息。异步事件也可以有一个有序的关系。例如，你通常不会收到一个问题的答案直到提出一个问题，但是你并没有阻止同时一些其他的东西。\n在日常生活中异步就这样发生了，所以我们不会经常想到。但让计算机程序的工作方式，来实现我们提出了的特殊的问题，会有一点复杂。在本质上，一个系统是异步和“事件驱动”将会表现出一个特定的，对我们来说，有价值的\n行为：它可以响应在任何时间以任何顺序发生的事件。\n这是我们要建立一种制度，正如我们将会看到，这是典范的 Netty 自底向上的支持。 \n"},"GETTING STARTED/Building Blocks.html":{"url":"GETTING STARTED/Building Blocks.html","title":"构成部分","keywords":"","body":"构成部分\n正如我们前面解释的，非阻塞 I/O 不会强迫我们等待操作的完成。在这种能力的基础上，真正的异步 I/O 起到了更进一步的作用:一个异步方法完成时立即返回并直接或稍后通知用户。\n正如我们将看到的,在一个网络环境的异步模型可以更有效地利用资源,可以快速连续执行多个调用。\nChannel\nChannel 是 NIO 基本的结构。它代表了一个用于连接到实体如硬件设备、文件、网络套接字或程序组件,能够执行一个或多个不同的 I/O 操作（例如读或写）的开放连接。\n现在,把 Channel 想象成一个可以“打开”或“关闭”,“连接”或“断开”和作为传入和传出数据的运输工具。\nCallback (回调)\ncallback (回调)是一个简单的方法,提供给另一种方法作为引用,这样后者就可以在某个合适的时间调用前者。这种技术被广泛使用在各种编程的情况下,最常见的方法之一通知给其他人操作已完成。\nNetty 内部使用回调处理事件时。一旦这样的回调被触发，事件可以由接口 ChannelHandler 的实现来处理。如下面的代码，一旦一个新的连接建立了,调用 channelActive(),并将打印一条消息。\nListing 1.2 ChannelHandler triggered by a callback\npublic class ConnectHandler extends ChannelInboundHandlerAdapter {\n    @Override\n    public void channelActive(ChannelHandlerContext ctx) throws Exception {   //1\n        System.out.println(\n                \"Client \" + ctx.channel().remoteAddress() + \" connected\");\n    }\n}\n1.当建立一个新的连接时调用 ChannelActive()\nFuture\nFuture 提供了另外一种通知应用操作已经完成的方式。这个对象作为一个异步操作结果的占位符,它将在将来的某个时候完成并提供结果。\nJDK 附带接口 java.util.concurrent.Future ,但所提供的实现只允许您手动检查操作是否完成或阻塞了。这是很麻烦的，所以 Netty 提供自己了的实现,ChannelFuture,用于在执行异步操作时使用。\nChannelFuture 提供多个附件方法来允许一个或者多个 ChannelFutureListener 实例。这个回调方法 operationComplete() 会在操作完成时调用。事件监听者能够确认这个操作是否成功或者是错误。如果是后者,我们可以检索到产生的 Throwable。简而言之, ChannelFutureListener 提供的通知机制不需要手动检查操作是否完成的。\n每个 Netty 的 outbound I/O 操作都会返回一个 ChannelFuture;这样就不会阻塞。这就是 Netty 所谓的“自底向上的异步和事件驱动”。\n下面例子简单的演示了作为 I/O 操作的一部分 ChannelFuture 的返回。当调用 connect() 将会直接是非阻塞的，并且调用在背后完成。由于线程是非阻塞的，所以无需等待操作完成，而可以去干其他事，因此这令资源利用更高效。\nListing 1.3 Callback in action\nChannel channel = ...;\n//不会阻塞\nChannelFuture future = channel.connect(\n    new InetSocketAddress(\"192.168.0.1\", 25));\n1.异步连接到远程地址\n下面代码描述了如何利用 ChannelFutureListener 。首先，连接到远程地址。接着，通过 ChannelFuture 调用 connect() 来 注册一个新ChannelFutureListener。当监听器被通知连接完成，我们检查状态。如果是成功，就写数据到 Channel，否则我们检索 ChannelFuture 中的Throwable。\n注意，错误的处理取决于你的项目。当然,特定的错误是需要加以约束\n的。例如,在连接失败的情况下你可以尝试连接到另一个。\nListing 1.4 Callback in action\nChannel channel = ...;\n//不会阻塞\nChannelFuture future = channel.connect(            //1\n        new InetSocketAddress(\"192.168.0.1\", 25));\nfuture.addListener(new ChannelFutureListener() {  //2\n@Override\npublic void operationComplete(ChannelFuture future) {\n    if (future.isSuccess()) {                    //3\n        ByteBuf buffer = Unpooled.copiedBuffer(\n                \"Hello\", Charset.defaultCharset()); //4\n        ChannelFuture wf = future.channel().writeAndFlush(buffer);                //5\n        // ...\n    } else {\n        Throwable cause = future.cause();        //6\n        cause.printStackTrace();\n    }\n}\n});\n1.异步连接到远程对等节点。调用立即返回并提供 ChannelFuture。\n2.操作完成后通知注册一个 ChannelFutureListener 。\n3.当 operationComplete() 调用时检查操作的状态。\n4.如果成功就创建一个 ByteBuf 来保存数据。\n5.异步发送数据到远程。再次返回ChannelFuture。\n6.如果有一个错误则抛出 Throwable,描述错误原因。\nEvent 和 Handler\nNetty 使用不同的事件来通知我们更改的状态或操作的状态。这使我们能够根据发生的事件触发适当的行为。\n这些行为可能包括：\n\n日志\n数据转换\n流控制\n应用程序逻辑\n\n由于 Netty 是一个网络框架,事件很清晰的跟入站或出站数据流相关。因为一些事件可能触发传入的数据或状态的变化包括:\n\n活动或非活动连接\n数据的读取\n用户事件\n错误\n\n出站事件是由于在未来操作将触发一个动作。这些包括:\n\n打开或关闭一个连接到远程\n写或冲刷数据到 socket\n\n每个事件都可以分配给用户实现处理程序类的方法。这说明了事件驱动的范例可直接转换为应用程序构建块。\n图1.3显示了一个事件可以由一连串的事件处理器来处理\nFigure 1.3 Event Flow\n\nNetty 的 ChannelHandler 是各种处理程序的基本抽象。想象下，每个处理器实例就是一个回调，用于执行对各种事件的响应。\n在此基础之上，Netty 也提供了一组丰富的预定义的处理程序,您可以开箱即用。比如，各种协议的编解码器包括 HTTP 和 SSL/TLS。在内部,ChannelHandler 使用事件和 future 本身,创建具有 Netty 特性抽象的消费者。\n整合\nFUTURE, CALLBACK 和 HANDLER\nNetty 的异步编程模型是建立在 future 和 callback 的概念上的。所有这些元素的协同为自己的设计提供了强大的力量。\n拦截操作和转换入站或出站数据只需要您提供回调或利用 future 操作返回的。这使得链操作简单、高效,促进编写可重用的、通用的代码。一个 Netty 的设计的主要目标是促进“关注点分离”:你的业务逻辑从网络基础设施应用程序中分离。\nSELECTOR, EVENT 和 EVENT LOOP\nNetty 通过触发事件从应用程序中抽象出 Selector，从而避免手写调度代码。EventLoop 分配给每个 Channel 来处理所有的事件，包括\n\n注册感兴趣的事件\n调度事件到 ChannelHandler\n安排进一步行动\n\n该 EventLoop 本身是由只有一个线程驱动，它给一个 Channel 处理所有的 I/O 事件，并且在 EventLoop 的生命周期内不会改变。这个简单而强大的线程模型消除你可能对你的 ChannelHandler 同步的任何关注，这样你就可以专注于提供正确的回调逻辑来执行。该 API 是简单和紧凑。\n"},"GETTING STARTED/About this Book.html":{"url":"GETTING STARTED/About this Book.html","title":"关于本书","keywords":"","body":"关于本书\n我们开始通过讨论阻塞和非阻塞处理之间的差异来了解到后一种方法的优点。然后，我们转移到了的 Netty的功能，设计和效益的概述。这些包括了Netty 的异步模型，包括回调，future 及其组合使用。我们还谈到了Netty 的线程模型，事件是如何被使用的，以及它们如何被拦截和处理。展望未来，我们将更加深入探索如何使用这些丰富的工具集用来满足特殊需求的应用。\n一路上，我们将介绍公司的工程师自己的案例研究解释为什么他们选择的Netty 以及他们如何使用它。\n因此，让我们开始吧。在下一章中，我们将深入研究了 Netty 的 API 的基础知识，编程模型，开始写 echo（回声）服务器和客户端。\n"},"GETTING STARTED/Your first Netty application.html":{"url":"GETTING STARTED/Your first Netty application.html","title":"第一个 Netty 应用","keywords":"","body":"第一个 Netty 应用\n在本章中，首先你要确保你有一个可以工作的开发环境，并通过构建一个简单的客户端和服务器来进行测试。虽然在开始下一章节前，我们还不会开始学习的 Netty 框架的细节，但在这里我们将会仔细观察我们所引入的 API 方面的内容，即通过 ChannelHandler 来实现应用的逻辑。\n"},"GETTING STARTED/Setting up the development environment.html":{"url":"GETTING STARTED/Setting up the development environment.html","title":"设置开发环境","keywords":"","body":"设置开发环境\n如果你已经有了 Maven 的开发环境，那你可以跳过本节。\n本书例子需要 JDK 和 Apache Maven,都可以免费下载到。\n1.安装配置 JDK\n建议用 JDK 7+ \n2.下载 IDE\nJAVA 的 IDE 很多，主流的有\n\nEclipse: http://www.eclipse.org\nNetBeans: http://www.netbeans.org\nIntellij Idea Community Edition: http://www.jetbrains.com\n\n3.下载安装 Maven\n可以参考：http://www.waylau.com/apache-maven-3-1-0-installation-deployment-and-use/\n4.配置工具\n确保系统环境变量有 JAVA_HOME 和 M2_HOME\n"},"GETTING STARTED/Netty client  server overview.html":{"url":"GETTING STARTED/Netty client  server overview.html","title":"Netty 客户端/服务端 总览","keywords":"","body":"Netty 客户端/服务器 总览\n在本节中，我们将构建一个完整的的 Netty客 户端和服务器。虽然你可能集中在写客户端是浏览器的基于 Web 的服务，接下来你将会获得更完整了解 Netty 的 API 是如何实现客户端和服务器的。\nFigure 2.1.Echo client / server\n\n图中显示了连接到服务器的多个并发的客户端。在理论上，客户端可以支持的连接数只受限于使用的 JDK 版本中的制约。\necho（回声）客户端和服务器之间的交互是很简单的;客户端启动后，建立一个连接发送一个或多个消息发送到服务器，其中每相呼应消息返回给客户端。诚然，这个应用程序并不是非常有用。但这项工作是为了更好的理解请求 - 响应交互本身，这是一个基本的模式的客户端/服务器系统。\n我们将通过检查服务器端代码开始。\n"},"GETTING STARTED/Writing the echo server.html":{"url":"GETTING STARTED/Writing the echo server.html","title":"写一个 echo 服务器","keywords":"","body":"写一个 echo 服务器\nNetty 实现的 echo 服务器都需要下面这些：\n\n一个服务器 handler：这个组件实现了服务器的业务逻辑，决定了连接创建后和接收到信息后该如何处理\nBootstrapping： 这个是配置服务器的启动代码。最少需要设置服务器绑定的端口，用来监听连接请求。\n\n通过 ChannelHandler 来实现服务器的逻辑\nEcho Server 将会将接受到的数据的拷贝发送给客户端。因此，我们需要实现 ChannelInboundHandler 接口，用来定义处理入站事件的方法。由于我们的应用很简单，只需要继承 ChannelInboundHandlerAdapter 就行了。这个类 提供了默认 ChannelInboundHandler 的实现，所以只需要覆盖下面的方法：\n\nchannelRead() - 每个信息入站都会调用\nchannelReadComplete() - 通知处理器最后的 channelread() 是当前批处理中的最后一条消息时调用\nexceptionCaught()- 读操作时捕获到异常时调用\n\nEchoServerHandler 代码如下：\nListing 2.2 EchoServerHandler\n@Sharable                                        //1\npublic class EchoServerHandler extends\n        ChannelInboundHandlerAdapter {\n\n    @Override\n    public void channelRead(ChannelHandlerContext ctx,\n        Object msg) {\n        ByteBuf in = (ByteBuf) msg;\n        System.out.println(\"Server received: \" + in.toString(CharsetUtil.UTF_8));

isActive, isOpen, isWritable, read, write 等等。 Netty 提供大量的 Channel 实现来专门使用。这些包括\nAbstractChannel，AbstractNioByteChannel，AbstractNioChannel，EmbeddedChannel，\nLocalServerChannel，NioSocketChannel 等等。\nCHANNELHANDLER\nChannelHandler 支持很多协议，并且提供用于数据处理的容器。我们已经知道 ChannelHandler 由特定事件触发。 ChannelHandler\n可专用于几乎所有的动作，包括将一个对象转为字节（或相反），执行过程中抛出的异常处理。\n常用的一个接口是 ChannelInboundHandler，这个类型接收到入站事件（包括接收到的数据）可以处理应用程序逻辑。当你需要提供响应时，你也可以从 ChannelInboundHandler 冲刷数据。一句话，业务逻辑经常存活于一个或者多个 ChannelInboundHandler。\nCHANNELPIPELINE\nChannelPipeline 提供了一个容器给 ChannelHandler 链并提供了一个API 用于管理沿着链入站和出站事件的流动。每个 Channel 都有自己的ChannelPipeline，当 Channel 创建时自动创建的。\nChannelHandler 是如何安装在 ChannelPipeline？ 主要是实现了ChannelHandler 的抽象 ChannelInitializer。ChannelInitializer子类 通过 ServerBootstrap 进行注册。当它的方法 initChannel() 被调用时，这个对象将安装自定义的 ChannelHandler 集到 pipeline。当这个操作完成时，ChannelInitializer 子类则\n从 ChannelPipeline 自动删除自身。\nEVENTLOOP\nEventLoop 用于处理 Channel 的 I/O 操作。一个单一的 EventLoop通常会处理多个 Channel 事件。一个 EventLoopGroup 可以含有多于一个的 EventLoop 和 提供了一种迭代用于检索清单中的下一个。\nCHANNELFUTURE\nNetty 所有的 I/O 操作都是异步。因为一个操作可能无法立即返回，我们需要有一种方法在以后确定它的结果。出于这个目的，Netty 提供了接口 \nChannelFuture,它的 addListener 方法注册了一个 ChannelFutureListener ，当操作完成时，可以被通知（不管成功与否）。\n更多关于 ChannelFuture\n想想一个 ChannelFuture 对象作为一个未来执行操作结果的占位符。何时执行取决于几个因素，因此不可能预测与精确。但我们可以肯定的是，它会被执行。此外，所有的操作返回 ChannelFuture 对象和属于同一个

ChannelHandler 是在您的应用程序的核心，尽管有时它\n可能并不明显。ChannelHandler 支持广泛的用途，使它难以界定。因此，最好是把它当作一个通用的容器，处理进来的事件（包括数据）并且通过ChannelPipeline。下图展示了 ChannelInboundHandler 和 ChannelOutboundHandler 继承自父接口 ChannelHandler。\nFigure 3.3 ChannelHandler class hierarchy\n\nNetty 中有两个方向的数据流，图3.4 显示的入站(ChannelInboundHandler)和出站(ChannelOutboundHandler)之间有一个明显的区别：若数据是从用户应用程序到远程主机则是“出站(outbound)”，相反若数据时从远程主机到用户应用程序则是“入站(inbound)”。\n为了使数据从一端到达另一端，一个或多个 ChannelHandler 将以某种方式操作数据。这些 ChannelHandler 会在程序的“引导”阶段被添加ChannelPipeline中，并且被添加的顺序将决定处理数据的顺序。\nFigure 3.4 ChannelPipeline with inbound and outbound ChannelHandlers\n\n图 3.4 同样展示了进站和出站的处理器都可以被安装在相同的 pipeline 。本例子中，如果消息或任何其他入站事件被读到，将从 pipeline 头部开始，传递到第一个 ChannelInboundHandler。该处理器可能会或可能不会实际修改数据，取决于其特定的功能，在这之后\n该数据将被传递到链中的下一个 ChannelInboundHandler。最后，将数据\n到达 pipeline 的尾部，此时所有处理结束。\n数据的出站运动（即，数据被“写入”）在概念上是相同的。在这种情况下的数据从尾部流过 ChannelOutboundHandlers 的链，直到它到达头部。超过这点，出站数据将到达的网络传输，在这里显示为一个 socket。通常，这将触发一个写入操作。\n更多 Inbound 、 Outbound Handler\n在当前的链（chain）中，事件可以通过 ChanneHandlerContext 传递给下一个 handler。Netty 为此提供了抽象基类ChannelInboundHandlerAdapter 和 hannelOutboundHandlerAdapter，用来处理你想要的事件。 这些类提供的方法的实现，可以简单地通过调用 ChannelHandlerContext 上的相应方法将事件传递给下一个 handler。在实际应用中，您可以按需覆盖相应的方法即可。\n所以，如果出站和入站操作是不同的，当 ChannelPipeline 中有混合处理器时将发生什么？虽然入站和出站处理器都扩展了 ChannelHandler，Netty 的 ChannelInboundHandler 的实现\n和 ChannelOutboundHandler 之间的是有区别的，从而保证数据传递只从一个处理器到下一个处理器保证正确的类型。\n当 ChannelHandler 被添加到的 ChannelPipeline 它得到一个\nChannelHandlerContext，它代表一个 ChannelHandler 和 ChannelPipeline 之间的“绑定”。它通常是安全保存对此对象的引用，除了当协议中的使用的是不面向连接（例如，UDP）。而该对象可以被用来获得\n底层 Channel,它主要是用来写出站数据。\n还有，实际上，在 Netty 发送消息有两种方式。您可以直接写消息给\nChannel

提供了一些默认的处理程序实现形式的“adapter（适配器）”类。这些旨在简化开发处理逻辑。我们已经看到，在 pipeline 中每个的 ChannelHandler 负责转发事件到链中的下一个处理器。这些适配器类（及其子类）会自动帮你实现，所以你只需要实现该特定的方法和事件。\n为什么用适配器？\n有几个适配器类，可以减少编写自定义 ChannelHandlers ，因为他们提供对应接口的所有方法的默认实现。（也有类似的适配器，用于创建编码器和解码器，这我们将在稍后讨论。）这些都是创建自定义处理器时，会经常调用的适配器：ChannelHandlerAdapter、ChannelInboundHandlerAdapter、ChannelOutboundHandlerAdapter、ChannelDuplexHandlerAdapter\n下面解释下三个 ChannelHandler 的子类型：编码器、解码器以及 ChannelInboundHandlerAdapter 的子类SimpleChannelInboundHandler\n编码器、解码器\n当您发送或接收消息时，Netty 数据转换就发生了。入站消息将从字节转为一个Java对象;也就是说，“解码”。如果该消息是出站相反会发生：“编码”，从一个Java对象转为字节。其原因是简单的：网络数据是一系列字节，因此需要从那类型进行转换。\n不同类型的抽象类用于提供编码器和解码器的，这取决于手头的任务。例如，应用程序可能并不需要马上将消息转为字节。相反，该​​消息将被转换\n一些其他格式。一个编码器将仍然可以使用，但它也将衍生自不同的超类，\n在一般情况下，基类将有一个名字类似 ByteToMessageDecoder 或\nMessageToByteEncoder。在一种特殊类型的情况下，你可能会发现类似\nProtobufEncoder 和 ProtobufDecoder，用于支持谷歌的 protocol buffer。\n严格地说，其他处理器可以做编码器和解码器能做的事。但正如适配器类简化创建通道处理器，所有的编码器/解码器适配器类 都实现自 ChannelInboundHandler 或 ChannelOutboundHandler。\n对于入站数据，channelRead 方法/事件被覆盖。这种方法在每个消息从入站 Channel 读入时调用。该方法将调用特定解码器的“解码”方法，并将解码后的消息转发到管道中下个的 ChannelInboundHandler。\n出站消息是类似的。编码器将消息转为字节，转发到下个的 ChannelOutboundHandler。\nSimpleChannelHandler\n也许最常见的处理器是接收到解码后的消息并应用一些业务逻辑到这些数据。要创建这样一个 ChannelHandler，你只需要扩展基类SimpleChannelInboundHandler 其中 T 是想要进行处理的类型。这样的处理器，你将覆盖基类的一个或多个方法，将获得被作为输入参数传递所有方法的 ChannelHandlerContext 的引用。\n在这种类型的处理器方法中的最重要是 channelRead0(ChannelHandlerContext，T)。在这个调用中，T 是将要处理的消息。\n你怎么做，完全取决于你，但无论如何你不能阻塞 I/O线程，因为这可能是不利于高性能。\n阻塞操作\nI/O 线程一定不能完全阻塞，因此禁止任何直接阻塞操作在你的 ChannelHandler， 有一种方法来实现这一要求。你可以指定一个 EventExecutorGroup 当添加 ChannelHandler 到ChannelPipeline。此 EventExecutorGroup  将用于获得EventExecutor，将执行所有的 ChannelHandler 的方法。这EventExecutor 将从 I/O

IOException {\n        final ServerSocket socket = new ServerSocket(port);     //1\n        try {\n            for (;;) {\n                final Socket clientSocket = socket.accept();    //2\n                System.out.println(\"Accepted connection from \" + clientSocket);\n\n                new Thread(new Runnable() {                        //3\n                    @Override\n

}\n}\n1.绑定服务器到指定的端口。\n2.接受一个连接。\n3.创建一个新的线程来处理连接。\n4.将消息发送到连接的客户端。\n5.一旦消息被写入和刷新时就 关闭连接。\n6.启动线程。\n上面的方式可以工作正常，但是这种阻塞模式在大连接数的情况就会有很严重的问题，如客户端连接超时，服务器响应严重延迟，性能无法扩展。为了解决这种情况，我们可以使用异步网络处理所有的并发连接，但问题在于 NIO 和 OIO 的 API 是完全不同的，所以一个用OIO开发的网络应用程序想要使用NIO重构代码几乎是重新开发。\n下面代码是使用 NIO 实现的例子：\nListing 4.2 Asynchronous networking without Netty\npublic class PlainNioServer {\n    public void serve(int port)

                 key.cancel();\n                    try {\n                        key.channel().close();\n                    } catch (IOException cex) {\n                        // 在关闭时忽略\n

获取 SelectionKey 实例。\n6.检查该事件是一个新的连接准备好接受。\n7.接受客户端，并用 selector 进行注册。\n8.检查 socket 是否准备好写数据。\n9.将数据写入到所连接的客户端。如果网络饱和，连接是可写的，那么这个循环将写入数据，直到该缓冲区是空的。\n10.关闭连接。\n如你所见，即使它们实现的功能是一样，但是代码完全不同。下面我们将用Netty 来实现相同的功能。\n采用 Netty 实现 I/O 和 NIO\n下面代码是使用Netty作为网络框架编写的一个阻塞 IO 例子：\nListing 4.3 Blocking networking with Netty\npublic class NettyOioServer {\n\n    public void server(int port) throws Exception {\n

ChannelInboundHandlerAdapter() 接收事件并进行处理\n5.写信息到客户端，并添加 ChannelFutureListener 当一旦消息写入就关闭连接\n6.绑定服务器来接受连接\n7.释放所有资源\n因为 Netty 使用相同的 API 来实现每个传输，它并不关心你使用什么来实现。Netty 通过操作接口Channel 、ChannelPipeline 和 ChannelHandler来实现。\n现在你了解到了用 基于 Netty 传输的好处。下面就来看下传输的 API.\n"},"CORE FUNCTIONS/Transport API.html":{"url":"CORE FUNCTIONS/Transport API.html","title":"Transport API","keywords":"","body":"Transport API\nTransport API 的核心是 Channel 接口，用于所有的出站操作，见下图\n\n如上图所示，每个 Channel 都会分配一个 ChannelPipeline 和ChannelConfig。ChannelConfig 负责设置并存储 Channel 的配置，并允许在运行期间更新它们。传输一般有特定的配置设置，可能实现了 ChannelConfig. 的子类型。\nChannelPipeline 容纳了使用的 ChannelHandler 实例，这些ChannelHandler 将处理通道传递的“入站”和“出站”数据以及事件。ChannelHandler 的实现允许你改变数据状态和传输数据。\n现在我们可以使用 ChannelHandler 做下面一些事情：\n\n传输数据时，将数据从一种格式转换到另一种格式\n异常通知\nChannel 变为 active（活动） 或 inactive（非活动） 时获得通知* Channel 被注册或注销时从 EventLoop 中获得通知\n通知用户特定事件\n\nIntercepting Filter（拦截过滤器）\nChannelPipeline 实现了常用的 Intercepting Filter（拦截过滤器）设计模式。UNIX管道是另一例子：命令链接在一起，一个命令的输出连接到\n的下一行中的输入。\n你还可以在运行时根据需要添加 ChannelHandler 实例到ChannelPipeline 或从 ChannelPipeline 中删除，这能帮助我们构建高度灵活的 Netty 程序。例如，你可以支持 STARTTLS 协议，只需通过加入适当的 ChannelHandler（这里是 SslHandler）到的ChannelPipeline 中，当被请求这个协议时。\n此外，访问指定的 ChannelPipeline 和 ChannelConfig，你能在Channel 自身上进行操作。Channel 提供了很多方法，如下列表：\nTable 4.1 Channel main methods\n\n\n\n方法名称\n描述\n\n\n\n\neventLoop()\n返回分配给Channel的EventLoop\n\n\npipeline()\n返回分配给Channel的ChannelPipeline\n\n\nisActive()\n返回Channel是否激活，已激活说明与远程连接对等\n\n\nlocalAddress()\n返回已绑定的本地SocketAddress\n\n\nremoteAddress()\n返回已绑定的远程SocketAddress\n\n\nwrite()\n写数据到远程客户端，数据通过ChannelPipeline传输过去\n\n\nflush()\n刷新先前的数据\n\n\nwriteAndFlush(...)\n一个方便的方法用户调用write(...)而后调用y flush()\n\n\n\n后面会越来越熟悉这些方法，现在只需要记住我们的操作都是在相同的接口上运行，Netty 的高灵活性让你可以以不同的传输实现进行重构。\n写数据到远程已连接客户端可以调用Channel.write()方法，如下代码：\nListing 4.5 Writing to a channel\nChannel channel = ...; // 获取channel的引用\nByteBuf buf = Unpooled.copiedBuffer(\"your data\", CharsetUtil.UTF_8);            //1\nChannelFuture cf = channel.writeAndFlush(buf); //2\n\ncf.addListener(new ChannelFutureListener() {    //3\n    @Override\n    public void operationComplete(ChannelFuture future) {\n        if (future.isSuccess()) {                //4\n            System.out.println(\"Write successful\");\n        } else {\n            System.err.println(\"Write error\");    //5\n            future.cause().printStackTrace();\n        }\n    }\n});\n1.创建 ByteBuf 保存写的数据\n2.写数据，并刷新\n3.添加 ChannelFutureListener 即可写操作完成后收到通知，\n4.写操作没有错误完成\n5.写操作完成时出现错误\nChannel 是线程安全(thread-safe)的，它可以被多个不同的线程安全的操作，在多线程环境下，所有的方法都是安全的。正因为 Channel 是安全的，我们存储对Channel的引用，并在学习的时候使用它写入数据到远程已连接的客户端，使用多线程也是如此。下面的代码是一个简单的多线程例子：\nListing 4.6 Using the channel from many threads\nfinal Channel channel = ...; // 获取channel的引用\nfinal ByteBuf buf = Unpooled.copiedBuffer(\"your data\",\n        CharsetUtil.UTF_8).retain();    //1\nRunnable writer = new Runnable() {        //2\n    @Override\n    public void run() {\n        channel.writeAndFlush(buf.duplicate());\n    }\n};\nExecutor executor = Executors.newCachedThreadPool();//3\n\n//写进一个线程\nexecutor.execute(writer);        //4\n\n//写进另外一个线程\nexecutor.execute(writer);        //5\n1.创建一个 ByteBuf 保存写的数据\n2.创建 Runnable 用于写数据到 channel\n3.获取 Executor 的引用使用线程来执行任务\n4.手写一个任务，在一个线程中执行\n5.手写另一个任务，在另一个线程中执行\n"},"CORE FUNCTIONS/Included transports.html":{"url":"CORE FUNCTIONS/Included transports.html","title":"包含的 Transport","keywords":"","body":"包含的 Transport\nNetty 自带了一些传输协议的实现，虽然没有支持所有的传输协议，但是其自带的已足够我们来使用。Netty应用程序的传输协议依赖于底层协议，本节我们将学习Netty中的传输协议。\nNetty中的传输方式有如下几种：\nTable 4.1 Provided transports\n\n\n\n方法名称\n包\n描述 \n\n\n\n\nNIO\nio.netty.channel.socket.nio\n基于java.nio.channels的工具包，使用选择器作为基础的方法。\n\n\nOIO\nio.netty.channel.socket.oio\n基于java.net的工具包，使用阻塞流。\n\n\nLocal\nio.netty.channel.local\n用来在虚拟机之间本地通信。\n\n\nEmbedded\nio.netty.channel.embedded\n嵌入传输，它允许在没有真正网络的传输中使用 ChannelHandler，可以非常有用的来测试ChannelHandler的实现。\n\n\n\nNIO-Nonblocking I/O\nNIO传输是目前最常用的方式，它通过使用选择器提供了完全异步的方式操作所有的 I/O，NIO 从Java 1.4才被提供。\nNIO 中，我们可以注册一个通道或获得某个通道的改变的状态，通道状态有下面几种改变：\n\n一个新的 Channel 被接受并已准备好\nChannel 连接完成\nChannel 中有数据并已准备好读取\nChannel 发送数据出去\n\n处理完改变的状态后需重新设置他们的状态，用一个线程来检查是否有已准备好的 Channel，如果有则执行相关事件。在这里可能只同时一个注册的事件而忽略其他的。选择器所支持的操作在 SelectionKey 中定义，具体如下：\nTable 4.2 Selection operation bit-set\n\n\n\n方法名称\n描述 \n\n\n\n\nOP_ACCEPT\n有新连接时得到通知\n\n\nOP_CONNECT\n连接完成后得到通知\n\n\nOP_REA\n准备好读取数据时得到通知\n\n\nOP_WRITE\n写入更多数据到通道时得到通知，大部分时间\n\n\n\n这是可能的，但有时 socket 缓冲区完全填满了。这通常发生在你写数据的速度太快了超过了远程节点的处理能力。\nFigure 4.2 Selecting and Processing State Changes\n\n1.新信道注册 WITH 选择器\n2.选择处理的状态变化的通知\n3.以前注册的通道\n4.Selector.select（）方法阻塞，直到新的状态变化接收或配置的超时\n已过\n5.检查是否有状态变化\n6.处理所有的状态变化\n7.在选择器操作的同一个线程执行其他任务\n有一种功能，目前仅适用于 NIO 传输叫什么 “zero-file-copy （零文件拷贝）”，这使您能够快速，高效地通过移动数据到从文件系统传输内容\n网络协议栈而无需复制从内核空间到用户空间。这可以使 FT P或 HTTP 协议有很大的不同。\n然而，并非所有的操作系统都支持此功能。此外，你不能用它实现数据加密或压缩文件系统 - 仅支持文件的原生内容。另一方面，传送的文件原本已经加密的是完全有效的。\n接下来，我们将讨论的是 OIO ，它提供了一个阻塞传输。\nOIO-Old blocking I/O\nNetty 中，该 OIO 传输代表了一种妥协。它通过了 Netty 的通用 API 访问但不是异步，而是构建在 java.net 的阻塞实现上。任何人下面讨论这一点可能会认为，这个协议并没有很大优势。但它确实有它有效的用途。\n假设你需要的端口使用该做阻塞调用库（例如 JDBC）。它可能不适合非阻塞。相反，你可以在短期内使用 OIO 传输，后来移植到纯异步的传输上。让我们看看它是如何工作的。\n在 java.net API，你通常有一个线程接受新的连接到达监听在ServerSocket，并创建一个新的线程来处理新的 Socket 。这是必需的，因为在一个特定的 socket的每个 I/O 操作可能会阻塞在任何时间。在一个线程处理多个 socket 易造成阻塞操作，一个　socket　占用了所有的其他人。\n鉴于此，你可能想知道　Netty　是如何用相同的　API　来支持　NIO　的异步传输。这里的　Netty　利用了　SO_TIMEOUT　标志，可以设置在一个　Socket。这　timeout　指定最大　毫秒　数量　用于等待　I/O　的操作完成。如果操作在指定的时间内失败，SocketTimeoutException　会被抛出。 Netty中捕获该异常并继续处理循环。在接下来的事件循环运行，它再次尝试。像　Netty　的异步架构来支持　OIO　的话，这其实是唯一的办法。当SocketTimeoutException　抛出时，执行　stack trace。\nFigure 4.3 OIO-Processing logic\n\n1.线程分配给 Socket\n2.Socket 连接到远程\n3.读操作（可能会阻塞）\n4.读完成\n5.处理可读的字节\n6.执行提交到 socket 的其他任务\n7.再次尝试读\n同个 JVM 内的本地 Transport 通信\nNetty 提供了“本地”传输，为运行在同一个 Java 虚拟机上的服务器和客户之间提供异步通信。此传输支持所有的 Netty 常见的传输实现的 API。\n在此传输中，与服务器 Channel 关联的 SocketAddress 不是“绑定”到一个物理网络地址中，而是在服务器是运行时它被存储在注册表中，当 Channel 关闭时它会注销。由于该传输不是“真正的”网络通信，它不能与其他传输实现互操作。因此，客户端是希望连接到使用本地传输的的服务器时，要注意正确的用法。除此限制之外，它的使用是与其他的传输是相同的。\n内嵌 Transport\nNetty中 还提供了可以嵌入 ChannelHandler 实例到其他的 ChannelHandler 的传输，使用它们就像辅助类，增加了灵活性的方法，使您可以与你的 ChannelHandler 互动。\n该嵌入技术通常用于测试 ChannelHandler 的实现，但它也可用于将功能添加到现有的 ChannelHandler 而无需更改代码。嵌入传输的关键是Channel 的实现，称为“EmbeddedChannel”。\n第10章描述了使用 EmbeddedChannel 来测试 ChannelHandlers。\n"},"CORE FUNCTIONS/Transport Use Cases.html":{"url":"CORE FUNCTIONS/Transport Use Cases.html","title":"Transport

FUNCTIONS/ByteBuf - The byte data container.html","title":"ByteBuf - 字节数据的容器","keywords":"","body":"ByteBuf - 字节数据的容器\n因为所有的网络通信最终都是基于底层的字节流传输，因此一个高效、方便、易用的数据接口是必要的，而 Netty 的 ByteBuf 满足这些需求。\nByteBuf 是一个很好的经过优化的数据容器，我们可以将字节数据有效的添加到 ByteBuf 中或从 ByteBuf 中获取数据。为了便于操作，ByteBuf 提供了两个索引：一个用于读，一个用于写。我们可以按顺序的读取数据，也可以通过调整读取数据的索引或者直接将读取位置索引作为参数传递给get方法来重复读取数据。\nByteBuf 是如何工作的？\n写入数据到 ByteBuf 后，writerIndex（写入索引）增加写入的字节数。读取字节后，readerIndex（读取索引）也增加读取出的字节数。你可以读取字节，直到写入索引和读取索引处在相同的位置。此时ByteBuf不可读，所以下一次读操作将会抛出 IndexOutOfBoundsException，就像读取数组时越位一样。\n调用 ByteBuf 的以 \"read\" 或 \"write\" 开头的任何方法都将自动增加相应的索引。另一方面，\"set\" 、 \"get\"操作字节将不会移动索引位置，它们只会在指定的相对位置上操作字节。\n可以给ByteBuf指定一个最大容量值，这个值限制着ByteBuf的容量。任何尝试将写入超过这个值的数据的行为都将导致抛出异常。ByteBuf 的默认最大容量限制是 Integer.MAX_VALUE。\nByteBuf 类似于一个字节数组，最大的区别是读和写的索引可以用来控制对缓冲区数据的访问。下图显示了一个容量为16的空的 ByteBuf  的布局和状态，writerIndex 和 readerIndex 都在索引位置 0 ：\nFigure 5.1 A 16-byte ByteBuf with its indices set to 0\n\nByteBuf 使用模式\nHEAP BUFFER(堆缓冲区)\n最常用的模式是 ByteBuf 将数据存储在 JVM 的堆空间，这是通过将数据存储在数组的实现。堆缓冲区可以快速分配，当不使用时也可以快速释放。它还提供了直接访问数组的方法，通过 ByteBuf.array() 来获取 byte[]数据。\n这种方法，正如清单5.1中所示的那样，是非常适合用来处理遗留数据的。\nListing 5.1 Backing array\nByteBuf heapBuf = ...;\nif (heapBuf.hasArray()) {                //1\n    byte[] array = heapBuf.array();        //2\n    int offset = heapBuf.arrayOffset() + heapBuf.readerIndex();                //3\n    int length = heapBuf.readableBytes();//4\n    handleArray(array, offset, length); //5\n}\n1.检查 ByteBuf 是否有支持数组。\n2.如果有的话，得到引用数组。\n3.计算第一字节的偏移量。\n4.获取可读的字节数。\n5.使用数组，偏移量和长度作为调用方法的参数。\n注意：\n\n访问非堆缓冲区 ByteBuf 的数组会导致UnsupportedOperationException， 可以使用 ByteBuf.hasArray()来检查是否支持访问数组。\n这个用法与 JDK 的 ByteBuffer 类似\n\nDIRECT BUFFER(直接缓冲区)\n“直接缓冲区”是另一个 ByteBuf 模式。对象的所有内存分配发生在\n堆，对不对？好吧，并非总是如此。在 JDK1.4 中被引入 NIO 的ByteBuffer 类允许 JVM 通过本地方法调用分配内存，其目的是\n\n通过免去中间交换的内存拷贝, 提升IO处理速度;\n直接缓冲区的内容可以驻留在垃圾回收扫描的堆区以外。\nDirectBuffer 在 -XX:MaxDirectMemorySize=xxM大小限制下, 使用 Heap 之外的内存, GC对此”无能为力”,也就意味着规避了在高负载下频繁的GC过程对应用线程的中断影响.(详见http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/ByteBuffer.html.)\n\n这就解释了为什么“直接缓冲区”对于那些通过 socket 实现数据传输的应用来说，是一种非常理想的方式。如果你的数据是存放在堆中分配的缓冲区，那么实际上，在通过 socket 发送数据之前，JVM 需要将先数据复制到直接缓冲区。\n但是直接缓冲区的缺点是在内存空间的分配和释放上比堆缓冲区更复杂，另外一个缺点是如果要将数据传递给遗留代码处理，因为数据不是在堆上，你可能不得不作出一个副本，如下：\nListing 5.2 Direct buffer data access\nByteBuf directBuf = ...\nif (!directBuf.hasArray()) {            //1\n    int length = directBuf.readableBytes();//2\n    byte[] array = new byte[length];    //3\n    directBuf.getBytes(directBuf.readerIndex(), array);        //4    \n    handleArray(array, 0, length);  //5\n}\n1.检查 ByteBuf 是不是由数组支持。如果不是，这是一个直接缓冲区。\n2.获取可读的字节数\n3.分配一个新的数组来保存字节\n4.字节复制到数组\n5.将数组，偏移量和长度作为参数调用某些处理方法\n显然，这比使用数组要多做一些工作。因此，如果你事前就知道容器里的数据将作为一个数组被访问，你可能更愿意使用堆内存。\nCOMPOSITE BUFFER(复合缓冲区)\n最后一种模式是复合缓冲区，我们可以创建多个不同的 ByteBuf，然后提供一个这些 ByteBuf 组合的视图。复合缓冲区就像一个列表，我们可以动态的添加和删除其中的 ByteBuf，JDK 的 ByteBuffer 没有这样的功能。\nNetty 提供了 ByteBuf 的子类 CompositeByteBuf 类来处理复合缓冲区，CompositeByteBuf 只是一个视图。\n警告\nCompositeByteBuf.hasArray() 总是返回 false，因为它可能既包含堆缓冲区，也包含直接缓冲区\n例如，一条消息由 header 和 body 两部分组成，将 header 和 body 组装成一条消息发送出去，可能 body 相同，只是 header 不同，使用CompositeByteBuf 就不用每次都重新分配一个新的缓冲区。下图显示CompositeByteBuf 组成 header 和 body：\nFigure 5.2 CompositeByteBuf holding a header and body\n\n下面代码显示了使用 JDK 的 ByteBuffer 的一个实现。两个 ByteBuffer 的数组创建保存消息的组件，第三个创建用于保存所有数据的副本。\nListing 5.3 Composite buffer pattern using ByteBuffer\n// 使用数组保存消息的各个部分\nByteBuffer[] message = { header, body };\n\n// 使用副本来合并这两个部分\nByteBuffer message2 = ByteBuffer.allocate(\n        header.remaining() + body.remaining());\nmessage2.put(header);\nmessage2.put(body);\nmessage2.flip();\n这种做法显然是低效的;分配和复制操作不是最优的方法，操纵数组使代码显得很笨拙。\n下面看使用 CompositeByteBuf 的改进版本\nListing 5.4 Composite buffer pattern using CompositeByteBuf\nCompositeByteBuf messageBuf = ...;\nByteBuf headerBuf = ...; // 可以支持或直接\nByteBuf bodyBuf = ...; // 可以支持或直接\nmessageBuf.addComponents(headerBuf, bodyBuf);\n// ....\nmessageBuf.removeComponent(0); // 移除头    //2\n\nfor (int i = 0; i 1.追加 ByteBuf 实例的 CompositeByteBuf\n2.删除  索引1的 ByteBuf\n3.遍历所有 ByteBuf 实例。\n清单5.4 所示，你可以简单地把 CompositeByteBuf 当作一个可迭代遍历的容器。\nCompositeByteBuf 不允许访问其内部可能存在的支持数组，也不允许直接访问数据，这一点类似于直接缓冲区模式，如图5.5所示。\nListing 5.5 Access data\nCompositeByteBuf compBuf = ...;\nint length = compBuf.readableBytes();    //1\nbyte[] array = new byte[length];        //2\ncompBuf.getBytes(compBuf.readerIndex(), array);    //3\nhandleArray(array, 0, length);    //4\n1.得到的可读的字节数。\n2.分配一个新的数组,数组长度为可读字节长度。\n3.读取字节到数组\n4.使用数组，把偏移量和长度作为参数\nNetty 尝试使用 CompositeByteBuf 优化 socket I/O 操作，消除\n原生 JDK 中可能存在的的性能低和内存消耗问题。虽然这是在Netty 的核心代码中进行的优化，并且是不对外暴露的，但是作为开发者还是应该意识到其影响。\nCompositeByteBuf API\nCompositeByteBuf 提供了大量的附加功能超出了它所继承的 ByteBuf。请参阅的 Netty 的 Javadoc 文档 API。\n"},"CORE FUNCTIONS/Byte-level Operations.html":{"url":"CORE FUNCTIONS/Byte-level Operations.html","title":"字节级别的操作","keywords":"","body":"字节级别的操作\n除了基本的读写操作， ByteBuf 还提供了它所包含的数据的修改方法。\n随机访问索引\nByteBuf 使用zero-based 的 indexing(从0开始的索引)，第一个字节的索引是 0，最后一个字节的索引是 ByteBuf 的 capacity - 1，下面代码是遍历 ByteBuf 的所有字节：\nListing 5.6 Access data\nByteBuf buffer = ...;\nfor (int i = 0; i 注意通过索引访问时不会推进 readerIndex （读索引）和 writerIndex（写索引），我们可以通过 ByteBuf 的 readerIndex(index) 或 writerIndex(index) 来分别推进读索引或写索引\n顺序访问索引\nByteBuf 提供两个指针变量支付读和写操作，读操作是使用 readerIndex()，写操作时使用 writerIndex()。这和JDK的ByteBuffer不同，ByteBuffer只有一个方法来设置索引，所以需要使用 flip() 方法来切换读和写模式。\nByteBuf 一定符合：0 \nFigure 5.3 ByteBuf internal segmentation\n\n1.字节，可以被丢弃，因为它们已经被读\n2.还没有被读的字节是：“readable bytes（可读字节）”\n3.空间可加入多个字节的是：“writeable bytes（写字节）”\n可丢弃字节的字节\n标有“可丢弃字节”的段包含已经被读取的字节。他们可以被丢弃，通过调用discardReadBytes() 来回收空间。这个段的初始大小存储在readerIndex，为 0，当“read”操作被执行时递增（“get”操作不会移动 readerIndex）。\n图5.4示出了在 图5.3 中的缓冲区中调用 discardReadBytes() 所示的结果。你可以看到，在丢弃字节段的空间已变得可用写。需要注意的是不能保证对可写的段之后的内容在 discardReadBytes() 方法之后已经被调用。\nFigure 5.4 ByteBuf after discarding read bytes.\n\n1.字节尚未被读出（readerIndex 现在 0）。\n2.可用的空间，由于空间被回收而增大。\nByteBuf.discardReadBytes() 可以用来清空 ByteBuf 中已读取的数据，从而使 ByteBuf 有多余的空间容纳新的数据，但是discardReadBytes() 可能会涉及内存复制，因为它需要移动 ByteBuf 中可读的字节到开始位置，这样的操作会影响性能，一般在需要马上释放内存的时候使用收益会比较大。\n可读字节\nByteBuf 的“可读字节”分段存储的是实际数据。新分配，包装，或复制的缓冲区的 readerIndex 的默认值为 0 。任何操作，其名称以 \"read\" 或 \"skip\" 开头的都将检索或跳过该数据在当前 readerIndex ，并且通过读取的字节数来递增。\n如果所谓的读操作是一个指定 ByteBuf 参数作为写入的对象，并且没有一个目标索引参数，目标缓冲区的 writerIndex 也会增加了。例如：\nreadBytes(ByteBuf dest);\n如果试图从缓冲器读取已经用尽的可读的字节，则抛出IndexOutOfBoundsException。清单5.8显示了如何读取所有可读字节。\nListing 5.7 Read all data\n//遍历缓冲区的可读字节\nByteBuf buffer= ...;\nwhile (buffer.isReadable()) {\n    System.out.println(buffer.readByte());\n}\n这段是未定义内容的地方，准备好写。一个新分配的缓冲区的 writerIndex 的默认值是 0 。任何操作，其名称 \"write\"开头的操作在当前的 writerIndex 写入数据时，递增字节写入的数量。如果写操作的目标也是 ByteBuf ，且未指定源索引，则源缓冲区的 readerIndex 将增加相同的量。例如：\nwriteBytes(ByteBuf dest);\n如果试图写入超出目标的容量，则抛出 IndexOutOfBoundException。\n下面的例子展示了填充随机整数到缓冲区中，直到耗尽空间。该方法writableBytes() 被用在这里确定是否存在足够的缓冲空间。\nListing 5.8 Write data\n//填充随机整数到缓冲区中\nByteBuf buffer = ...;\nwhile (buffer.writableBytes() >= 4) {\n    buffer.writeInt(random.nextInt());\n}\n索引管理\n在 JDK 的 InputStream 定义了 mark(int readlimit) 和 reset()方法。这些是分别用来标记流中的当前位置和复位流到该位置。\n同样，您可以设置和重新定位ByteBuf readerIndex 和 writerIndex 通过调用 markReaderIndex(), markWriterIndex(), resetReaderIndex() 和 resetWriterIndex()。这些类似于InputStream 的调用，所不同的是，没有 readlimit 参数来指定当标志变为无效。\n您也可以通过调用 readerIndex(int) 或 writerIndex(int) 将指标移动到指定的位置。在尝试任何无效位置上设置一个索引将导致 IndexOutOfBoundsException 异常。\n调用 clear() 可以同时设置 readerIndex 和 writerIndex 为 0。注意，这不会清除内存中的内容。让我们看看它是如何工作的。 （图5.5图重复5.3 ）\nFigure 5.5 Before clear() is called\n\n调用之前，包含3个段，下面显示了调用之后\nFigure 5.6 After clear() is called\n\n现在 整个 ByteBuf 空间都是可写的了。\nclear() 比 discardReadBytes() 更低成本，因为他只是重置了索引，而没有内存拷贝。\n查询操作\n有几种方法，以确定在所述缓冲器中的指定值的索引。最简单的是使用 indexOf() 方法。更复杂的搜索执行以 ByteBufProcessor 为参数的方法。这个接口定义了一个方法，boolean process(byte value)，它用来报告输入值是否是一个正在寻求的值。\nByteBufProcessor 定义了很多方便实现共同目标值。例如，假设您的应用程序需要集成所谓的“Flash sockets”，将使用 NULL 结尾的内容。调用\nforEachByte（ByteBufProcessor.FIND_NUL）\n通过减少的，因为少量的\n“边界检查”的处理过程中执行了，从而使 消耗 Flash 数据变得 编码工作量更少、效率更高。\n下面例子展示了寻找一个回车符，\\ r的一个例子。\nListing 5.9 Using ByteBufProcessor to find \\r\nByteBuf buffer = ...;\nint index = buffer.forEachByte(ByteBufProcessor.FIND_CR);\n衍生的缓冲区\n“衍生的缓冲区”是代表一个专门的展示 ByteBuf 内容的“视图”。这种视图是由 duplicate(), slice(), slice(int, int),readOnly(), 和 order(ByteOrder) 方法创建的。所有这些都返回一个新的 ByteBuf 实例包括它自己的 reader, writer 和标记索引。然而，内部数据存储共享就像在一个 NIO 的 ByteBuffer。这使得衍生的缓冲区创建、修改其\n内容，以及修改其“源”实例更廉价。\nByteBuf 拷贝\n如果需要已有的缓冲区的全新副本，使用 copy() 或者 copy(int, int)。不同于派生缓冲区，这个调用返回的 ByteBuf 有数据的独立副本。\n若需要操作某段数据，使用 slice(int, int)，下面展示了用法：\nListing 5.10 Slice a ByteBuf\nCharset utf8 = Charset.forName(\"UTF-8\");\nByteBuf buf = Unpooled.copiedBuffer(\"Netty in Action rocks!\", utf8); //1\n\nByteBuf sliced = buf.slice(0, 14);          //2\nSystem.out.println(sliced.toString(utf8));  //3\n\nbuf.setByte(0, (byte) 'J');                 //4\nassert buf.getByte(0) == sliced.getByte(0);\n1.创建一个 ByteBuf 保存特定字节串。\n2.创建从索引 0 开始，并在 14 结束的 ByteBuf 的新 slice。\n3.打印 Netty in Action\n4.更新索引 0 的字节。\n5.断言成功，因为数据是共享的，并以一个地方所做的修改将在其他地方可见。\n下面看下如何将一个 ByteBuf 段的副本不同于 slice。\nListing 5.11 Copying a ByteBuf\nCharset utf8 = Charset.forName(\"UTF-8\");\nByteBuf buf = Unpooled.copiedBuffer(\"Netty in Action rocks!\", utf8);     //1\n\nByteBuf copy = buf.copy(0, 14);               //2\nSystem.out.println(copy.toString(utf8));      //3\n\nbuf.setByte(0, (byte) 'J');                   //4\nassert buf.getByte(0) != copy.getByte(0);\n1.创建一个 ByteBuf 保存特定字节串。\n2.创建从索引0开始和 14 结束 的 ByteBuf 的段的拷贝。\n3.打印 Netty in Action\n4.更新索引 0 的字节。\n5.断言成功，因为数据不是共享的，并以一个地方所做的修改将不影响其他。\n代码几乎是相同的，但所 衍生的 ByteBuf 效果是不同的。因此，使用一个 slice 可以尽可能避免复制内存。\n读/写操作\n读/写操作主要由2类：\n\ngget()/set() 操作从给定的索引开始，保持不变\nread()/write() 操作从给定的索引开始，与字节访问的数量来适用，递增当前的写索引或读索引\n\nByteBuf 的各种读写方法或其他一些检查方法可以看 ByteBuf 的 API，下面是常见的 get() 操作：\nTable 5.1 get()

Reference source not found..” 一节\nChannelOutboundHandler\nChannelOutboundHandler 提供了出站操作时调用的方法。这些方法会被 Channel, ChannelPipeline, 和 ChannelHandlerContext 调用。\nChannelOutboundHandler 另个一个强大的方面是它具有在请求时延迟操作或者事件的能力。比如，当你在写数据到 remote peer 的过程中被意外暂停，你可以延迟执行刷新操作，然后在迟些时候继续。\n下面显示了 ChannelOutboundHandler 的方法（继承自 ChannelHandler 未列出来）\nTable 6.4 ChannelOutboundHandler methods\n\n\n\n类型\n描述\n\n\n\n\nbind\nInvoked on request to bind the Channel to a local address\n\n\nconnect\nInvoked on request to connect the Channel to the remote peer\n\n\ndisconnect\nInvoked on request to disconnect the Channel from the remote peer\n\n\nclose\nInvoked on request to close the Channel\n\n\nderegister\nInvoked on request to deregister the Channel from its EventLoop\n\n\nread\nInvoked on request to read more data from the Channel\n\n\nflush\nInvoked on request to flush queued data to the remote peer through the Channel\n\n\nwrite\nInvoked on request to write data through the Channel to the remote peer\n\n\n\n几乎所有的方法都将 ChannelPromise 作为参数,一旦请求结束要通过 ChannelPipeline 转发的时候，必须通知此参数。\nChannelPromise vs. ChannelFuture\nChannelPromise 是 特殊的 ChannelFuture，允许你的 ChannelPromise 及其 操作 成功或失败。所以任何时候调用例如 Channel.write(...) 一个新的  ChannelPromise将会创建并且通过 ChannelPipeline传递。这次写操作本身将会返回 ChannelFuture， 这样只允许你得到一次操作完成的通知。Netty 本身使用 ChannelPromise 作为返回的 ChannelFuture 的通知，事实上在大多数时候就是 ChannelPromise 自身（ChannelPromise 扩展了 ChannelFuture）\n如前所述,ChannelOutboundHandlerAdapter 提供了一个实现了 ChannelOutboundHandler 所有基本方法的实现的框架。\n这些简单事件转发到下一个 ChannelOutboundHandler 管道通过调用\nChannelHandlerContext 相关的等效方法。你可以根据需要自己实现想要的方法。\n资源管理\n当你通过 ChannelInboundHandler.channelRead(...) 或者\nChannelOutboundHandler.write(...) 来处理数据，重要的是在处理资源时要确保资源不要泄漏。\nNetty 使用引用计数器来处理池化的 ByteBuf。所以当 ByteBuf 完全处理后，要确保引用计数器被调整。\n引用计数的权衡之一是用户时必须小心使用消息。当 JVM 仍在 GC(不知道有这样的消息引用计数)这个消息，以至于可能是之前获得的这个消息不会被放回池中。因此很可能,如果你不小心释放这些消息，很可能会耗尽资源。\n为了让用户更加简单的找到遗漏的释放，Netty 包含了一个 ResourceLeakDetector ，将会从已分配的缓冲区 1% 作为样品来检查是否存在在应用程序泄漏。因为 1% 的抽样,开销很小。\n对于检测泄漏,您将看到类似于下面的日志消息。\nLEAK: ByteBuf.release() was not called before it’s garbage-collected. Enable advanced leak reporting to find out where the leak occurred. To enable advanced\nleak reporting, specify the JVM option ’-Dio.netty.leakDetectionLevel=advanced’ or call ResourceLeakDetector.setLevel()\n\nRelaunch your application with the JVM option mentioned above, then you’ll see the recent locations of your application where the leaked buffer was accessed. The following output shows a leak from our unit test (XmlFrameDecoderTest.testDecodeWithXml()):\n\nRunning io.netty.handler.codec.xml.XmlFrameDecoderTest\n\n15:03:36.886 [main] ERROR io.netty.util.ResourceLeakDetector - LEAK:\nByteBuf.release() was not called before it’s garbage-collected.\n\nRecent access records: 1\n\n#1:\n\nio.netty.buffer.AdvancedLeakAwareByteBuf.toString(AdvancedLeakAwareByteBuf.java:697)\n\nio.netty.handler.codec.xml.XmlFrameDecoderTest.testDecodeWithXml(XmlFrameDecoderTest.java:157)\n    io.netty.handler.codec.xml.XmlFrameDecoderTest.testDecodeWithTwoMessages(XmlFrameDecoderTest.java:133)\n泄漏检测等级\nNetty 现在定义了四种泄漏检测等级，可以按需开启，见下表\nTable 6.5 Leak detection levels\n\n\n\nLevel Description\nDISABLED\n\n\n\n\nDisables\nLeak detection completely.

This it has a massive impact on performance. Use this only in the debugging phase.\n\n\n\n修改检测等级，只需修改 io.netty.leakDetectionLevel 系统属性，举例\n# java -Dio.netty.leakDetectionLevel=paranoid\n这样，我们就能在 ChannelInboundHandler.channelRead(...) 和  ChannelOutboundHandler.write(...) 避免泄漏。\n当你处理 channelRead(...) 操作，并在消费消息(不是通过 ChannelHandlerContext.fireChannelRead(...) 来传递它到下个 ChannelInboundHandler)  时，要释放它，如下：\nListing 6.3 Handler that consume inbound data\n@ChannelHandler.Sharable\npublic class DiscardInboundHandler extends ChannelInboundHandlerAdapter {  //1\n\n    @Override\n    public void channelRead(ChannelHandlerContext ctx,\n                                     Object msg) {\n        ReferenceCountUtil.release(msg); //2\n    }\n\n}\n\n继承 ChannelInboundHandlerAdapter\n使用 ReferenceCountUtil.release(...) 来释放资源\n\n所以记得，每次处理消息时，都要释放它。\nSimpleChannelInboundHandler -消费入站消息更容易\n使用入站数据和释放它是一项常见的任务，Netty 为你提供了一个特殊的称为 SimpleChannelInboundHandler 的 ChannelInboundHandler 的实现。该实现将自动释放一个消息，一旦这个消息被用户通过channelRead0() 方法消费。\n当你在处理写操作，并丢弃消息时，你需要释放它。现在让我们看下实际是如何操作的。\nListing 6.4 Handler to discard outbound data\n@ChannelHandler.Sharable\npublic class DiscardOutboundHandler\n        extends ChannelOutboundHandlerAdapter { //1\n@Override\npublic void write(ChannelHandlerContext ctx,\n                                 Object msg, ChannelPromise promise) {\n    ReferenceCountUtil.release(msg);  //2\n    promise.setSuccess();    //3\n\n}\n}\n\n继承 ChannelOutboundHandlerAdapter\n使用 ReferenceCountUtil.release(...) 来释放资源\n通知 ChannelPromise 数据已经被处理\n\n重要的是，释放资源并通知 ChannelPromise。如果，ChannelPromise 没有被通知到，这可能会引发 ChannelFutureListener 不会被处理的消息通知的状况。\n所以，总结下：如果消息是被 消耗/丢弃 并不会被传入下个 ChannelPipeline 的 ChannelOutboundHandler ，调用 ReferenceCountUtil.release(message) 。一旦消息经过实际的传输，在消息被写或者 Channel 关闭时，它将会自动释放。\n"},"CORE FUNCTIONS/ChannelPipeline.html":{"url":"CORE FUNCTIONS/ChannelPipeline.html","title":"ChannelPipeline","keywords":"","body":"ChannelPipeline\nChannelPipeline 是一系列的ChannelHandler 实例,用于拦截 流经一个 Channel 的入站和出站事件,ChannelPipeline允许用户自己定义对入站/出站事件的处理逻辑，以及pipeline里的各个Handler之间的交互。\n每一次创建了新的Channel ,都会新建一个新的 ChannelPipeline并绑定到Channel上。这个关联是\n永久性的;Channel 既不能附上另一个 ChannelPipeline 也不能分离\n当前这个。这些都由Netty负责完成,而无需开发人员的特别处理。\n根据它的起源,一个事件将由 ChannelInboundHandler 或\nChannelOutboundHandler 处理。随后它将调用 ChannelHandlerContext 实现转发到下一个相同的超类型的处理程序。\nChannelHandlerContext\n一个 ChannelHandlerContext 使 ChannelHandler 与 ChannelPipeline 和\n其他处理程序交互。一个处理程序可以通知下一个 ChannelPipeline 中的 ChannelHandler 甚至动态修改 ChannelPipeline 的归属。\n下图展示了用于入站和出站 ChannelHandler 的 典型 ChannelPipeline 布局。\n\nFigure 6.2 ChannelPipeline and ChannelHandlers\n上图说明了 ChannelPipeline 主要是一系列 ChannelHandler。通过ChannelPipeline ChannelPipeline 还提供了方法传播事件本身。如果一个入站事件被触发，它将被传递的从 ChannelPipeline 开始到结束。举个例子,在这个图中出站 I/O 事件将从 ChannelPipeline 右端开始一直处理到左边。\nChannelPipeline 相对论\n你可能会说,从 ChannelPipeline 事件传递的角度来看,ChannelPipeline 的“开始” 取决于是否入站或出站事件。然而,Netty 总是指 ChannelPipeline 入站口(图中的左边)为“开始”,出站口(右边)作为“结束”。当我们完成使用 ChannelPipeline.add() 添加混合入站和出站处理程序,每个 ChannelHandler 的“顺序”是它的地位从“开始”到“结束”正如我们刚才定义的。因此,如果我们在图6.1处理程序按顺序从左到右第一个ChannelHandler被一个入站事件将是#1,第一个处理程序被出站事件将是#5*\n随着管道传播事件,它决定下个 ChannelHandler 是否是相匹配的方向运动的类型。如果没有,ChannelPipeline 跳过 ChannelHandler 并继续下一个合适的方向。记住,一个处理程序可能同时实现ChannelInboundHandler 和 ChannelOutboundHandler 接口。\n修改 ChannelPipeline\nChannelHandler 可以实时修改 ChannelPipeline 的布局，通过添加、移除、替换其他 ChannelHandler（也可以从 ChannelPipeline 移除 ChannelHandler 自身）。这个 是 ChannelHandler 重要的功能之一。\nTable 6.6 ChannelHandler methods for modifying a ChannelPipeline\n\n\n\n名称\n描述\n\n\n\n\naddFirst addBefore addAfter addLast\n添加 ChannelHandler 到 ChannelPipeline.\n\n\nRemove\n从 ChannelPipeline 移除 ChannelHandler.\n\n\nReplace\n在 ChannelPipeline 替换另外一个 ChannelHandler\n\n\n\n下面展示了操作\nListing 6.5 Modify the ChannelPipeline\nChannelPipeline pipeline = null;

 //2\n    }\n}\n\n添加 @Sharable 注解\n日志方法调用， 并专递到下一个 ChannelHandler\n\n上面这个 ChannelHandler 实现符合所有包含在多个管道的要求;它通过@Sharable 注解，并不持有任何状态。而下面清单6.11中列出的情况则恰恰相反,它会造成问题。\nListing 6.11 Invalid usage of @Sharable\n@ChannelHandler.Sharable  //1\npublic class NotSharableHandler extends ChannelInboundHandlerAdapter {\n    private int count;\n\n    @Override\n    public void channelRead(ChannelHandlerContext ctx, Object msg) {\n        count++;

The encoded messages are forwarded to the next ChannelOutboundHandler in the pipeline\n\n\n\nMessageToMessageCodec 是一个参数化的类，定义如下：\npublic abstract class MessageToMessageCodec\n上面所示的完整签名的方法都是这样的\nprotected abstract void encode(ChannelHandlerContext ctx,\nOUTBOUND msg, List out)\nprotected abstract void decode(ChannelHandlerContext ctx,\nINBOUND msg, List out)\nencode() 处理出站消息类型 OUTBOUND 到 INBOUND，而 decode() 则相反。我们在哪里可能使用这样的编解码器?\n在现实中,这是一个相当常见的用例,往往涉及两个来回转换的数据消息传递API 。这是常有的事,当我们不得不与遗留或专有的消息格式进行互操作。\n如清单7.7所示这样的可能性。在这个例子中,WebSocketConvertHandler 是一个静态嵌套类，继承了参数为 WebSocketFrame（类型为 INBOUND）和 WebSocketFrame（类型为 OUTBOUND）的 MessageToMessageCode\nListing 7.7 MessageToMessageCodec\npublic class WebSocketConvertHandler extends MessageToMessageCodec {  //1\n\n    public static final WebSocketConvertHandler INSTANCE = new WebSocketConvertHandler();\n\n    @Override\n    protected void encode(ChannelHandlerContext ctx, WebSocketFrame msg, List out) throws Exception {   \n        ByteBuf payload = msg.getData().duplicate().retain();\n        switch (msg.getType()) {   //2\n            case BINARY:\n                out.add(new BinaryWebSocketFrame(payload));\n                break;\n            case TEXT:\n                out.add(new TextWebSocketFrame(payload));\n                break;\n            case CLOSE:\n                out.add(new CloseWebSocketFrame(true, 0, payload));\n                break;\n            case CONTINUATION:\n                out.add(new ContinuationWebSocketFrame(payload));\n                break;\n            case PONG:\n                out.add(new PongWebSocketFrame(payload));\n                break;\n            case PING:\n                out.add(new PingWebSocketFrame(payload));\n                break;\n            default:\n                throw new IllegalStateException(\"Unsupported websocket msg \" + msg);\n        }\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    protected void decode(ChannelHandlerContext ctx, io.netty.handler.codec.http.websocketx.WebSocketFrame msg, List out) throws Exception {\n        if (msg instanceof BinaryWebSocketFrame) {  //3\n            out.add(new WebSocketFrame(WebSocketFrame.FrameType.BINARY, msg.content().copy()));\n        } else if (msg instanceof CloseWebSocketFrame) {\n            out.add(new WebSocketFrame(WebSocketFrame.FrameType.CLOSE, msg.content().copy()));\n        } else if (msg instanceof PingWebSocketFrame) {\n            out.add(new WebSocketFrame(WebSocketFrame.FrameType.PING, msg.content().copy()));\n        } else if (msg instanceof PongWebSocketFrame) {\n            out.add(new WebSocketFrame(WebSocketFrame.FrameType.PONG, msg.content().copy()));\n        } else if (msg instanceof TextWebSocketFrame) {\n            out.add(new WebSocketFrame(WebSocketFrame.FrameType.TEXT, msg.content().copy()));\n        } else if (msg instanceof ContinuationWebSocketFrame) {\n            out.add(new WebSocketFrame(WebSocketFrame.FrameType.CONTINUATION, msg.content().copy()));\n        } else {\n            throw new IllegalStateException(\"Unsupported websocket msg \" + msg);\n        }\n    }\n\n    public static final class WebSocketFrame {  //4\n        public enum FrameType {        //5\n            BINARY,\n            CLOSE,\n            PING,\n            PONG,\n            TEXT,\n            CONTINUATION\n        }\n\n        private final FrameType type;\n        private final ByteBuf data;\n        public WebSocketFrame(FrameType type, ByteBuf data) {\n            this.type = type;\n            this.data = data;\n        }\n\n        public FrameType getType() {\n            return type;\n        }\n\n        public ByteBuf getData() {\n            return data;\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n编码 WebSocketFrame 消息转为 WebSocketFrame 消息\n检测 WebSocketFrame 的 FrameType 类型，并且创建一个新的响应的 FrameType 类型的 WebSocketFrame\n通过 instanceof 来检测正确的 FrameType\n自定义消息类型 WebSocketFrame\n枚举类明确了 WebSocketFrame 的类型\n\nCombinedChannelDuplexHandler\n如前所述,结合解码器和编码器在一起可能会牺牲可重用性。为了避免这种方式，并且部署一个解码器和编码器到 ChannelPipeline 作为逻辑单元而不失便利性。\n关键是下面的类:\npublic class CombinedChannelDuplexHandler\n这个类是扩展 ChannelInboundHandler 和 ChannelOutboundHandler 参数化的类型。这提供了一个容器,单独的解码器和编码器类合作而无需直接扩展抽象的编解码器类。我们将在下面的例子说明这一点。首先查看 ByteToCharDecoder ，如清单7.8所示。\nListing 7.8 ByteToCharDecoder\npublic class ByteToCharDecoder extends\n        ByteToMessageDecoder { //1\n\n    @Override\n    public void decode(ChannelHandlerContext ctx, ByteBuf in, List out)\n            throws Exception {\n        if (in.readableBytes() >= 2) {  //2\n            out.add(in.readChar());\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n继承 ByteToMessageDecoder\n写 char 到 MessageBuf\n\ndecode() 方法从输入数据中提取两个字节,并将它们作为一个 char 写入 List 。(注意,实现扩展 ByteToMessageDecoder 因为它从 ByteBuf 读取字符。)\n现在看一下清单7.9中,把字符转换为字节的编码器。\nListing 7.9 CharToByteEncoder\npublic class CharToByteEncoder extends\n        MessageToByteEncoder { //1\n\n    @Override\n    public void encode(ChannelHandlerContext ctx, Character msg, ByteBuf out)\n            throws Exception {\n        out.writeChar(msg);   //2\n    }\n}\n\n继承 MessageToByteEncoder\n写 char 到 ByteBuf\n\n这个实现继承自 MessageToByteEncoder 因为他需要编码 char 消息 到 ByteBuf。这将直接将字符串写为 ByteBuf。\n现在我们有编码器和解码器，将他们组成一个编解码器。见下面的 CombinedChannelDuplexHandler.\nListing 7.10 CombinedByteCharCodec\npublic class CombinedByteCharCodec extends CombinedChannelDuplexHandler {\n    public CombinedByteCharCodec() {\n        super(new ByteToCharDecoder(), new CharToByteEncoder());\n    }\n}\n\nCombinedByteCharCodec 的参数是解码器和编码器的实现用于处理进站字节和出站消息\n传递 ByteToCharDecoder 和 CharToByteEncoder 实例到 super 构造函数来委托调用使他们结合起来。\n\n正如你所看到的,它可能是用上述方式来使程序更简单、更灵活,而不是使用一个以上的编解码器类。它也可以归结到你个人喜好或风格。\n"},"CORE FUNCTIONS/7.5  Summary.html":{"url":"CORE FUNCTIONS/7.5  Summary.html","title":"总结","keywords":"","body":"总结\n在这一章里,我们研究了 Netty 的 codec API 来编写解码器和编码器。我们还学习了为什么最好使用这个而不是纯ChannelHandler API。\n我们看到不同的抽象编解码器类提供支持来处理在一个类中实现解码和编码。另一方面,如果我们需要更大的灵活性,希望结合现有实现我们也可以选择结合他们无需扩展抽象编解码器的任何类。\n在下一章,我们将讨论 ChannelHandler 的实现和编解码器,他们是 Netty 本身的一部分，您可以开箱即用的处理特定的协议和任务。\n"},"CORE FUNCTIONS/Provided ChannelHandlers and Codecs.html":{"url":"CORE FUNCTIONS/Provided ChannelHandlers and Codecs.html","title":"提供了的 ChannelHandler 和 Codec","keywords":"","body":"已经提供的 ChannelHandler 和 Codec\n本章介绍\n\n使用 SSL/TLS 加密 Netty 程序\n构建 Netty HTTP/HTTPS 程序\n处理空闲连接和超时\n解码分隔符和基于长度的协议\n写大数据\n序列化数据\n\nNetty 提供了很多共同协议的编解码器和处理程序,您可以几乎“开箱即用”的使用他们,而无需花在相当乏味的基础设施问题。在这一章里,我们将探索这些工具和他们的好处。这包括支持 SSL/TLS,WebSocket 和 谷歌SPDY,通过数据压缩使 HTTP 有更好的性能。\n"},"CORE FUNCTIONS/Securing Netty applications with SSLTLS.html":{"url":"CORE FUNCTIONS/Securing Netty applications with SSLTLS.html","title":"使用 SSL/TLS 加密 Netty 程序","keywords":"","body":"使用 SSL/TLS 加密 Netty 程序\n今天数据隐私是一个十分关注的问题,作为开发人员,我们需要准备好解决这个问题。至少我们需要熟悉加密协议 SSL 和 TLS 等之上的其他协议实现数据安全。作为一个 HTTPS 网站的用户,你是安全。当然,这些协议是广泛不基于 http 的应用程序,例如安全SMTP(SMTPS)邮件服务,甚至关系数据库系统。\n为了支持 SSL/TLS,Java 提供了 javax.net.ssl API 的类SslContext 和 SslEngine 使它相对简单的实现解密和加密。Netty 的利用该 API 命名 SslHandler 的 ChannelHandler 实现,\n有一个内部 SslEngine 做实际的工作。\n图8.1显示了一个使用 SslHandler 数据流图。\n\n\n加密的入站数据被 SslHandler 拦截，并被解密\n前面加密的数据被 SslHandler 解密\n平常数据传过 SslHandler\nSslHandler 加密数据并它传递出站\n\nFigure 8.1 Data flow through SslHandler for decryption and encryption\n如清单8.1所示一个 SslHandler 使用 ChannelInitializer 添加到 ChannelPipeline。(回想一下,当 Channel 注册时 ChannelInitializer 用于设置 ChannelPipeline 。)\nListing 8.1 Add SSL/TLS support\npublic class SslChannelInitializer extends ChannelInitializer {\n\n    private final SslContext context;\n    private final boolean startTls;\n    public SslChannelInitializer(SslContext context,\n    boolean client, boolean startTls) {   //1\n        this.context = context;\n        this.startTls = startTls;\n    }\n    @Override\n    protected void initChannel(Channel ch) throws Exception {\n        SSLEngine engine = context.newEngine(ch.alloc());

ChannelHandler,是如何允许您使用 HTTP 和 HTTPS 而无需编写自己的编解码器。\nHTTP Decoder, Encoder 和 Codec\nHTTP 是请求-响应模式，客户端发送一个 HTTP 请求，服务就响应此请求。Netty 提供了简单的编码、解码器来简化基于这个协议的开发工作。图8.2和图8.3显示 HTTP 请求和响应的方法是如何生产和消费的\n\n\nHTTP

HTTP 请求和响应可以由许多部分组合而成，你需要聚合他们形成完整的消息。为了消除这种繁琐任务， Netty 提供了一个聚合器,合并消息部件到 FullHttpRequest 和 FullHttpResponse 消息。这样您总是能够看到完整的消息内容。\n这个操作有一个轻微的成本,消息段需要缓冲,直到完全可以将消息转发到下一个 ChannelInboundHandler 管道。但好处是,你不必担心消息碎片。\n实现自动聚合只需添加另一个 ChannelHandler 到 ChannelPipeline。清单8.3显示了这是如何实现的。\nListing 8.3 Automatically aggregate HTTP message fragments\npublic class HttpAggregatorInitializer extends

负载，现在的硬件设施都很强大，大多数时候压缩数据时一个好主意。Netty 支持“gzip”和“deflate”，为此提供了两个 ChannelHandler 实现分别用于压缩和解压。看下面代码：\nHTTP Request Header\n客户端可以通过提供下面的头显示支持加密模式。然而服务器不是,所以不得不压缩它发送的数据。\nGET /encrypted-area HTTP/1.1\nHost: www.example.com\nAccept-Encoding: gzip, deflate\n下面是一个例子\nListing 8.4 Automatically compress HTTP messages\npublic class HttpAggregatorInitializer extends ChannelInitializer {\n\n

HttpServerCodec\nserver: HttpContentCompressor 用于压缩来自 client  支持的  HttpContentCompressor\n\n压缩与依赖\n注意，Java 6或者更早版本，如果要压缩数据，需要添加 jzlib 到 classpath\n\n    com.jcraft\n        jzlib\n    1.1.3\n\n使用 HTTPS\n启用 HTTPS，只需添加 SslHandler\nListing 8.5 Using HTTPS\npublic class HttpsCodecInitializer extends ChannelInitializer {\n\n    private final SslContext context;\n    private final boolean client;\n\n    public HttpsCodecInitializer(SslContext context, boolean client) {\n        this.context = context;\n        this.client = client;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    protected void initChannel(Channel ch) throws Exception {\n        ChannelPipeline pipeline = ch.pipeline();\n        SSLEngine engine = context.newEngine(ch.alloc());\n        pipeline.addFirst(\"ssl\", new SslHandler(engine));  //1\n\n        if (client) {\n            pipeline.addLast(\"codec\", new HttpClientCodec());  //2\n        } else {\n            pipeline.addLast(\"codec\", new HttpServerCodec());  //3\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n添加 SslHandler 到 pipeline 来启用  HTTPS\nclient: 添加 HttpClientCodec\nserver: 添加 HttpServerCodec ，如果是 server 模式的话\n\n上面的代码就是一个很好的例子，解释了 Netty 的架构是如何让“重用”变成了“杠杆”。我们可以添加一个新的功能,甚至是一样重要的加密支持,几乎没有工作量,只需添加一个ChannelHandler 到 ChannelPipeline。\nWebSocket\nHTTP 是不错的协议，但是如果需要实时发布信息怎么做？有个做法就是客户端一直轮询请求服务器，这种方式虽然可以达到目的，但是其缺点很多，也不是优秀的解决方案，为了解决这个问题，便出现了 WebSocket。\nWebSocket 允许数据双向传输，而不需要请求-响应模式。早期的WebSocket 只能发送文本数据，然后现在不仅可以发送文本数据，也可以发送二进制数据，这使得可以使用 WebSocket 构建你想要的程序。下图是WebSocket 的通信示例图：\nWebSocket 规范及其实现是为了一个更有效的解决方案。简单的说,\n一个WebSocket 提供一个 TCP 连接两个方向的交通。结合 WebSocket API 它提供了一个替代 HTTP 轮询双向通信从页面到远程服务器。\n也就是说,WebSocket 提供真正的双向客户机和服务器之间的数据交换。\n我们不会对内部太多的细节,但我们应该提到,虽然最早实现仅限于文本数据，但现在不再是这样,WebSocket可以用于任意数据,就像一个正常的套接字。\n图8.4给出了一个通用的 WebSocket 协议。在这种情况下的通信开始于普通 HTTP ，并“升级”为双向 WebSocket。\n\n\nClient (HTTP) 与 Server 通讯\nServer (HTTP) 与 Client 通讯\nClient 通过 HTTP(s) 来进行 WebSocket 握手,并等待确认\n连接协议升级至 WebSocket\n\nFigure 8.4 WebSocket protocol\n添加应用程序支持 WebSocket 只需要添加适当的客户端或服务器端WebSocket ChannelHandler 到管道。这个类将处理特殊 WebSocket 定义的消息类型,称为“帧。“如表8.3所示,这些可以归类为“数据”和“控制”帧。\nTable 8.3 WebSocketFrame types\n\n\n\n名称\n描述\n\n\n\n\nBinaryWebSocketFrame\nData frame: binary data\n\n\nTextWebSocketFrame\nData frame: text data\n\n\nContinuationWebSocketFrame\nData frame: text or binary data that belongs to a previous BinaryWebSocketFrame or TextWebSocketFrame\n\n\nCloseWebSocketFrame\nControl frame: a CLOSE request, close status code and a phrase\n\n\nPingWebSocketFrame\nControl frame: requests the send of a PongWebSocketFrame\n\n\nPongWebSocketFrame\nControl frame: sent as response to a PingWebSocketFrame\n\n\n\n由于 Netty 的主要是一个服务器端技术重点在这里创建一个 WebSocket server 。清单8.6使用 WebSocketServerProtocolHandler 提出了一个简单的例子。该类处理协议升级握手以及三个“控制”帧 Close, Ping 和 Pong。Text 和 Binary 数据帧将被传递到下一个处理程序(由你实现)进行处理。\nListing 8.6 Support WebSocket on the server\npublic class

HTTP/S。一旦连接升级，之后的数据传输都将使用 WebSocket 。\n下面看下服务器的逻辑图\nFigure 11.2 Server logic\n\n＃1客户端/用户连接到服务器并加入聊天\n＃2 HTTP 请求页面或 WebSocket 升级握手\n＃3服务器处理所有客户端/用户\n＃4响应 URI “/”的请求，转到 index.html\n＃5如果访问的是 URI“/ws” ，处理 WebSocket 升级握手\n＃6升级握手完成后 ，通过 WebSocket 发送聊天消息\n处理 HTTP 请求\n本节我们将实现此应用中用于处理 HTTP 请求的组件，这个组件托管着可供客户端访问的聊天室页面，并且显示客户端发送的消息。\n下面就是这个 HttpRequestHandler 的代码,它是一个用来处理 FullHttpRequest 消息的 ChannelInboundHandler 的实现类。注意看它是怎么实现忽略符合 \"/ws\" 格式的\nURI 请求的。\nListing 11.1 HTTPRequestHandler\npublic class HttpRequestHandler extends SimpleChannelInboundHandler {    //1\n    private final String wsUri;\n    private static final File INDEX;\n\n    static {\n        URL location = HttpRequestHandler.class.getProtectionDomain().getCodeSource().getLocation();\n        try {\n            String path = location.toURI() + \"index.html\";\n            path = !path.contains(\"file:\") ? path : path.substring(5);\n            INDEX = new File(path);\n        } catch (URISyntaxException e) {\n            throw new IllegalStateException(\"Unable to locate index.html\", e);\n        }\n    }\n\n    public HttpRequestHandler(String wsUri) {\n        this.wsUri = wsUri;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void channelRead0(ChannelHandlerContext ctx, FullHttpRequest request) throws Exception {\n        if (wsUri.equalsIgnoreCase(request.getUri())) {\n            ctx.fireChannelRead(request.retain());                    //2\n        } else {\n            if (HttpHeaders.is100ContinueExpected(request)) {\n                send100Continue(ctx);                                //3\n            }\n\n            RandomAccessFile file = new RandomAccessFile(INDEX, \"r\");//4\n\n            HttpResponse response = new DefaultHttpResponse(request.getProtocolVersion(), HttpResponseStatus.OK);\n            response.headers().set(HttpHeaders.Names.CONTENT_TYPE, \"text/html; charset=UTF-8\");\n\n            boolean keepAlive = HttpHeaders.isKeepAlive(request);\n\n            if (keepAlive) {                                        //5\n                response.headers().set(HttpHeaders.Names.CONTENT_LENGTH, file.length());\n                response.headers().set(HttpHeaders.Names.CONNECTION, HttpHeaders.Values.KEEP_ALIVE);\n            }\n            ctx.write(response);                    //6\n\n            if (ctx.pipeline().get(SslHandler.class) == null) {        //7\n                ctx.write(new DefaultFileRegion(file.getChannel(), 0, file.length()));\n            } else {\n                ctx.write(new ChunkedNioFile(file.getChannel()));\n            }\n            ChannelFuture future = ctx.writeAndFlush(LastHttpContent.EMPTY_LAST_CONTENT);            //8\n            if (!keepAlive) {\n                future.addListener(ChannelFutureListener.CLOSE);        //9\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    private static void send100Continue(ChannelHandlerContext ctx) {\n        FullHttpResponse response = new DefaultFullHttpResponse(HttpVersion.HTTP_1_1, HttpResponseStatus.CONTINUE);\n        ctx.writeAndFlush(response);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void exceptionCaught(ChannelHandlerContext ctx, Throwable cause)\n            throws Exception {\n        cause.printStackTrace();\n        ctx.close();\n    }\n}\n1.扩展 SimpleChannelInboundHandler 用于处理 FullHttpRequest信息\n2.如果请求是一次升级了的 WebSocket 请求，则递增引用计数器（retain）并且将它传递给在  ChannelPipeline 中的下个 ChannelInboundHandler \n3.处理符合 HTTP 1.1的 \"100 Continue\" 请求\n4.读取 index.html\n5.判断 keepalive 是否在请求头里面\n6.写 HttpResponse 到客户端\n7.写 index.html 到客户端，根据 ChannelPipeline 中是否有 SslHandler 来决定使用 DefaultFileRegion 还是 ChunkedNioFile\n8.写并刷新 LastHttpContent 到客户端，标记响应完成\n9.如果 请求头中不包含 keepalive，当写完成时，关闭 Channel\nHttpRequestHandler 做了下面几件事，\n\n如果该 HTTP 请求被发送到URI “/ws”，则调用 FullHttpRequest 上的 retain()，并通过调用 fireChannelRead(msg) 转发到下一个 ChannelInboundHandler。retain() 的调用是必要的，因为 channelRead() 完成后，它会调用 FullHttpRequest 上的 release() 来释放其资源。 （请参考我们先前在第6章中关于 SimpleChannelInboundHandler 的讨论）\n如果客户端发送的 HTTP 1.1 头是“Expect: 100-continue” ，则发送“100 Continue”的响应。\n在 头被设置后，写一个 HttpResponse 返回给客户端。注意，这不是 FullHttpResponse，这只是响应的第一部分。另外，这里我们也不使用 writeAndFlush()， 这个是在留在最后完成。\n如果传输过程既没有要求加密也没有要求压缩，那么把 index.html 的内容存储在一个 DefaultFileRegion 里就可以达到最好的效率。这将利用零拷贝来执行传输。出于这个原因，我们要检查 ChannelPipeline 中是否有一个 SslHandler。如果是的话，我们就使用 ChunkedNioFile。\n写 LastHttpContent 来标记响应的结束，并终止它\n如果不要求 keepalive ，添加 ChannelFutureListener 到 ChannelFuture 对象的最后写入，并关闭连接。注意，这里我们调用 writeAndFlush() 来刷新所有以前写的信息。\n\n这里展示了应用程序的第一部分，用来处理纯的 HTTP 请求和响应。接下来我们将处理 WebSocket 的 frame（帧），用来发送聊天消息。\nWebSocket frame\nWebSockets 在“帧”里面来发送数据，其中每一个都代表了一个消息的一部分。一个完整的消息可以利用了多个帧。\n处理 WebSocket frame\nWebSocket \"Request for Comments\" (RFC) 定义了六种不同的 frame; Netty 给他们每个都提供了一个 POJO 实现 ，见下表：\nTable 11.1 WebSocketFrame types\n\n\n\n名称\n描述\n\n\n\n\nBinaryWebSocketFrame\ncontains binary data\n\n\nTextWebSocketFrame\ncontains text data\n\n\nContinuationWebSocketFrame\ncontains text or binary data that belongs to a previous BinaryWebSocketFrame or TextWebSocketFrame\n\n\nCloseWebSocketFrame\nrepresents a CLOSE request and contains close status code and a phrase\n\n\nPingWebSocketFrame\nrequests the transmission of a PongWebSocketFrame\n\n\nPongWebSocketFrame\nsent as a response to a PingWebSocketFrame\n\n\n\n我们的程序只需要使用下面4个帧类型：\n\nCloseWebSocketFrame\nPingWebSocketFrame\nPongWebSocketFrame\nTextWebSocketFrame\n\n在这里我们只需要处理 TextWebSocketFrame，其他的会由 WebSocketServerProtocolHandler 自动处理。\n下面代码展示了 ChannelInboundHandler 处理 TextWebSocketFrame，同时也将跟踪在 ChannelGroup 中所有活动的 WebSocket 连接\nListing 11.2 Handles Text frames\npublic class TextWebSocketFrameHandler extends SimpleChannelInboundHandler { //1\n    private final ChannelGroup group;\n\n    public TextWebSocketFrameHandler(ChannelGroup group) {\n        this.group = group;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void userEventTriggered(ChannelHandlerContext ctx, Object evt) throws Exception {    //2\n        if (evt == WebSocketServerProtocolHandler.ServerHandshakeStateEvent.HANDSHAKE_COMPLETE) {\n\n            ctx.pipeline().remove(HttpRequestHandler.class);    //3\n\n            group.writeAndFlush(new TextWebSocketFrame(\"Client \" + ctx.channel() + \" joined\"));//4\n\n            group.add(ctx.channel());    //5\n        } else {\n            super.userEventTriggered(ctx, evt);\n        }\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void channelRead0(ChannelHandlerContext ctx, TextWebSocketFrame msg) throws Exception {\n        group.writeAndFlush(msg.retain());    //6\n    }\n}\n1.扩展 SimpleChannelInboundHandler 用于处理 TextWebSocketFrame 信息 \n2.覆写userEventTriggered() 方法来处理自定义事件 \n3.如果接收的事件表明握手成功,就从 ChannelPipeline 中删除HttpRequestHandler ，因为接下来不会接受 HTTP 消息了\n4.写一条消息给所有的已连接 WebSocket 客户端，通知它们建立了一个新的 Channel 连接\n5.添加新连接的 WebSocket Channel 到 ChannelGroup 中，这样它就能收到所有的信息\n6.保留收到的消息，并通过  writeAndFlush() 传递给所有连接的客户端。\n上面显示了 TextWebSocketFrameHandler 仅作了几件事：\n\n当WebSocket 与新客户端已成功握手完成，通过写入信息到 ChannelGroup 中的 Channel  来通知所有连接的客户端，然后添加新 Channel 到 ChannelGroup\n如果接收到 TextWebSocketFrame，调用 retain() ，并将其写、刷新到 ChannelGroup，使所有连接的 WebSocket Channel 都能接收到它。和以前一样，retain() 是必需的，因为当 channelRead0（）返回时，TextWebSocketFrame 的引用计数将递减。由于所有操作都是异步的，writeAndFlush() 可能会在以后完成，我们不希望它访问无效的引用。\n\n由于 Netty 在其内部处理了其余大部分功能，唯一剩下的需要我们去做的就是为每一个新创建的 Channel 初始化 ChannelPipeline 。要完成这个，我们需要一个ChannelInitializer\n初始化 ChannelPipeline\n接下来，我们需要安装我们上面实现的两个 ChannelHandler 到 ChannelPipeline。为此，我们需要继承 ChannelInitializer 并且实现 initChannel()。看下面 ChatServerInitializer  的代码实现\nListing 11.3 Init the ChannelPipeline\npublic class ChatServerInitializer extends ChannelInitializer {    //1\n    private final ChannelGroup group;\n\n    public ChatServerInitializer(ChannelGroup group) {\n        this.group = group;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    protected void initChannel(Channel ch) throws Exception {            //2\n        ChannelPipeline pipeline = ch.pipeline();\n        pipeline.addLast(new HttpServerCodec());\n        pipeline.addLast(new HttpObjectAggregator(64 * 1024));\n        pipeline.addLast(new ChunkedWriteHandler());\n        pipeline.addLast(new HttpRequestHandler(\"/ws\"));\n        pipeline.addLast(new WebSocketServerProtocolHandler(\"/ws\"));\n        pipeline.addLast(new TextWebSocketFrameHandler(group));\n    }\n}\n1.扩展  ChannelInitializer\n2.添加 ChannelHandler　到 ChannelPipeline\ninitChannel() 方法用于设置所有新注册的 Channel 的ChannelPipeline,安装所有需要的 ChannelHandler。总结如下：\nTable 11.2 ChannelHandlers for the WebSockets Chat server\n\n\n\nChannelHandler　\n　职责\n\n\n\n\nHttpServerCodec\nDecode bytes to HttpRequest, HttpContent, LastHttpContent.Encode HttpRequest, HttpContent, LastHttpContent to bytes.\n\n\nChunkedWriteHandler\nWrite the contents of a file.\n\n\nHttpObjectAggregator\nThis ChannelHandler aggregates an HttpMessage and its following HttpContents into a single FullHttpRequest or FullHttpResponse (depending on whether it is being used to handle requests or responses).With this installed the next ChannelHandler in the pipeline will receive only full HTTP requests.\n\n\nHttpRequestHandler\nHandle FullHttpRequests (those not sent to \"/ws\" URI).\n\n\nWebSocketServerProtocolHandler\nAs required by the WebSockets specification, handle the WebSocket Upgrade handshake, PingWebSocketFrames,PongWebSocketFrames and CloseWebSocketFrames.\n\n\nTextWebSocketFrameHandler\nHandles TextWebSocketFrames and handshake completion events\n\n\n\n该 WebSocketServerProtocolHandler 处理所有规定的 WebSocket 帧类型和升级握手本身。如果握手成功所需的 ChannelHandler 被添加到管道，而那些不再需要的则被去除。管道升级之前的状态如下图。这代表了 ChannelPipeline 刚刚经过 ChatServerInitializer 初始化。\nFigure 11.3 ChannelPipeline before WebSockets Upgrade\n\n握手升级成功后 WebSocketServerProtocolHandler 替换HttpRequestDecoder 为 WebSocketFrameDecoder，HttpResponseEncoder 为WebSocketFrameEncoder。 为了最大化性能，WebSocket 连接不需要的 ChannelHandler 将会被移除。其中就包括了 HttpObjectAggregator 和 HttpRequestHandler\n下图，展示了 ChannelPipeline 经过这个操作完成后的情况。注意 Netty 目前支持四个版本 WebSocket 协议，每个通过其自身的方式实现类。选择正确的版本WebSocketFrameDecoder 和 WebSocketFrameEncoder 是自动进行的，这取决于在客户端（在这里指浏览器）的支持（在这个例子中，我们假设使用版本是 13 的 WebSocket 协议，从而图中显示的是 WebSocketFrameDecoder13 和 WebSocketFrameEncoder13）。\nFigure 11.4 ChannelPipeline after WebSockets Upgrade\n\n引导\n最后一步是 引导服务器，设置 ChannelInitializer\npublic class ChatServer {\n\n    private final ChannelGroup channelGroup = new DefaultChannelGroup(ImmediateEventExecutor.INSTANCE);//1\n    private final EventLoopGroup group = new NioEventLoopGroup();\n    private Channel channel;\n\n    public ChannelFuture start(InetSocketAddress address) {\n        ServerBootstrap bootstrap  = new ServerBootstrap(); //2\n        bootstrap.group(group)\n                .channel(NioServerSocketChannel.class)\n                .childHandler(createInitializer(channelGroup));\n        ChannelFuture future = bootstrap.bind(address);\n        future.syncUninterruptibly();\n        channel = future.channel();\n        return future;\n    }\n\n    protected ChannelInitializer createInitializer(ChannelGroup group) {        //3\n       return new ChatServerInitializer(group);\n    }\n\n    public void destroy() {        //4\n        if (channel != null) {\n            channel.close();\n        }\n        channelGroup.close();\n        group.shutdownGracefully();\n    }\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception{\n        if (args.length != 1) {\n            System.err.println(\"Please give port as argument\");\n            System.exit(1);\n        }\n        int port = Integer.parseInt(args[0]);\n\n        final ChatServer endpoint = new ChatServer();\n        ChannelFuture future = endpoint.start(new InetSocketAddress(port));\n\n        Runtime.getRuntime().addShutdownHook(new Thread() {\n            @Override\n            public void run() {\n                endpoint.destroy();\n            }\n        });\n        future.channel().closeFuture().syncUninterruptibly();\n    }\n}\n1.创建  DefaultChannelGroup 用来 保存所有连接的的 WebSocket channel\n2.引导 服务器\n3.创建 ChannelInitializer\n4.处理服务器关闭，包括释放所有资源\n"},"NETTY BY EXAMPLE/Testing the Application.html":{"url":"NETTY BY EXAMPLE/Testing the

，然后配置一下即可。如下：\nListing 11.6 Add encryption to the ChannelPipeline\npublic class SecureChatServerIntializer extends ChatServerInitializer {    //1\n    private final SslContext context;\n\n    public SecureChatServerIntializer(ChannelGroup group, SslContext context) {\n        super(group);\n        this.context = context;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    protected void initChannel(Channel ch) throws

//2\n    }\n}\n1.扩展 ChatServerInitializer 来实现加密\n2.向 ChannelPipeline 中添加SslHandler\n最后修改 ChatServer，使用 SecureChatServerInitializer 并传入 SSLContext\nListing 11.7 Add encryption to the ChatServer\npublic

,应对不同的状态代码,这取决于资源存在与否,但基本的概念将是相同的。\n我们的下一个任务将会提供一个组件来支持 SPDY 作为首选协议。\nNetty 提供了简单的处理 SPDY 方法。这些将使您能够重用FullHttpRequest 和 FullHttpResponse 消息，通过 SPDY 透明地接收和发送他们。\nHttpRequestHandler 虽然是我们可以重用代码,我们将改变我们的内容写回客户端只是强调协议变化;通常您会返回相同的内容。下面的清单展示了实现,它扩展了先前的 HttpRequestHandler。\nListing 12.3 Implementation that handles SPDY\n@ChannelHandler.Sharable\npublic class SpdyRequestHandler extends HttpRequestHandler {   //1\n    @Override\n    protected String getContent() {\n        return \"This content is transmitted via SPDY\\r\\n\";  //2\n    }\n}\n\n继承 HttpRequestHandler 这样就能共享相同的逻辑\n生产内容写到 payload。这个重写了 HttpRequestHandler 的\ngetContent() 的实现\n\nSpdyRequestHandler 继承自 HttpRequestHandler,但区别是:写入的内容的 payload 状态的响应是在 SPDY 写的。\n我们可以实现两个处理程序逻辑,将选择一个相匹配的协议。然而添加以前写过的处理程序到 ChannelPipeline 是不够的;正确的编解码器还需要补充。它的责任是检测传输字节数,然后使用 FullHttpResponse 和 FullHttpRequest 的抽象进行工作。\nNetty 的附带一个基类,完全能做这个。所有您需要做的是实现逻辑选择协议和选择适当的处理程序。\n清单12.4显示了实现,它使用 Netty 的提供的抽象基类。\npublic class DefaultSpdyOrHttpChooser extends SpdyOrHttpChooser {\n\n    public DefaultSpdyOrHttpChooser(int maxSpdyContentLength, int maxHttpContentLength) {\n        super(maxSpdyContentLength, maxHttpContentLength);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    protected SelectedProtocol getProtocol(SSLEngine engine) {\n        DefaultServerProvider provider = (DefaultServerProvider) NextProtoNego.get(engine);  //1\n        String protocol = provider.getSelectedProtocol();\n        if (protocol == null) {\n            return SelectedProtocol.UNKNOWN; //2\n        }\n        switch (protocol) {\n            case \"spdy/2\":\n                return SelectedProtocol.SPDY_2; //3\n            case \"spdy/3.1\":\n                return SelectedProtocol.SPDY_3_1; //4\n            case \"http/1.1\":\n                return SelectedProtocol.HTTP_1_1; //5\n            default:\n                return SelectedProtocol.UNKNOWN; //6\n        }\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    protected ChannelInboundHandler createHttpRequestHandlerForHttp() {\n        return new HttpRequestHandler(); //7\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    protected ChannelInboundHandler createHttpRequestHandlerForSpdy() {\n        return new SpdyRequestHandler();  //8\n    }\n}\n\n使用 NextProtoNego 用于获取 DefaultServerProvider 的引用, 用于 SSLEngine\n协议不能被检测到。一旦字节已经准备好读,检测过程将重新开始。\nSPDY 2 被检测到\nSPDY 3 被检测到\nHTTP 1.1 被检测到\n未知协议被检测到\n将会被调用给 FullHttpRequest 消息添加处理器。该方法只会在不支持 SPDY 时调用，那么将会使用 HTTPS\n将会被调用给 FullHttpRequest 消息添加处理器。该方法在支持 SPDY 时调用\n\n该实现要注意检测正确的协议并设置 ChannelPipeline 。它可以处理SPDY 版本 2、3 和 HTTP 1.1,但可以很容易地修改 SPDY 支持额外的版本。\n设置 ChannelPipeline\n通过实现 ChannelInitializer 将所有的处理器连接到一起。正如你所了解的那样,这将设置 ChannelPipeline 并添加所有需要的ChannelHandler 的。\nSPDY 需要两个 ChannelHandler:\n\nSslHandler,用于检测 SPDY 是否通过 TLS 扩展\nDefaultSpdyOrHttpChooser,用于当协议被检测到时，添加正确的 ChannelHandler 到 ChannelPipeline\n\n除了添加 ChannelHandler 到 ChannelPipeline, ChannelInitializer 还有另一个责任;即,分配之前创建的 DefaultServerProvider 通过 SslHandler 到 SslEngine 。这将通过Jetty NPN 类库的 NextProtoNego helper 类实现\nListing 12.5 Implementation that handles SPDY\npublic class SpdyChannelInitializer extends ChannelInitializer {  //1\n    private final SslContext context;\n\n    public SpdyChannelInitializer(SslContext context) //2 {\n        this.context = context;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    protected void initChannel(SocketChannel ch) throws Exception {\n        ChannelPipeline pipeline = ch.pipeline();\n        SSLEngine engine = context.newEngine(ch.alloc());  //3\n        engine.setUseClientMode(false);  //4\n\n        NextProtoNego.put(engine, new DefaultServerProvider());  //5\n        NextProtoNego.debug = true;\n\n        pipeline.addLast(\"sslHandler\", new SslHandler(engine));  //6\n        pipeline.addLast(\"chooser\", new DefaultSpdyOrHttpChooser(1024 * 1024, 1024 * 1024));\n    }\n}\n\n继承 ChannelInitializer 是一个简单的开始\n传递 SSLContext 用于创建 SSLEngine\n新建 SSLEngine,用于新的管道和连接\n配置 SSLEngine 用于非客户端使用\n通过 NextProtoNego helper 类绑定 DefaultServerProvider 到 SSLEngine \n添加 SslHandler 到 ChannelPipeline 这将会在协议检测到时保存在 ChannelPipeline\n添加 DefaultSpyOrHttpChooser 到 ChannelPipeline 。这个实现将会监测协议。添加正确的 ChannelHandler 到 ChannelPipeline,并且移除自身\n\n实际的 ChannelPipeline 设置将会在 DefaultSpdyOrHttpChooser 实现之后完成,因为在这一点上它可能只需要知道客户端是否支持 SPDY\n为了说明这一点,让我们总结一下,看看不同 ChannelPipeline 状态期间与客户连接的生命周期。图12.2显示了在  Channel 初始化后的 ChannelPipeline。\n\nFigure 12.2 ChannelPipeline after connection\n现在,这取决于客户端是否支持 SPDY,管道将修改DefaultSpdyOrHttpChooser 来处理协议。之后并不需要添加所需的 ChannelHandler  到 ChannelPipeline,所以删除本身。这个逻辑是由抽象 SpdyOrHttpChooser 类封装,DefaultSpdyOrHttpChooser 父类。\n图12.3显示了支持 SPDY 的 ChannelPipeline 用于连接客户端的配置。\n\nFigure 12.3 ChannelPipeline if SPDY is supported\n每个 ChannelHandler 负责的一小部分工作,这个就是对基于 Netty 构造的应用程序最完美的诠释。每个 ChannelHandler 的职责如表12.3所示。\nTable 12.3 Responsibilities of the ChannelHandlers when SPDY is used\n\n\n\n名称\n职责\n\n\n\n\nSslHandler\n加解密两端交换的数据\n\n\nSpdyFrameDecoder\n从接收到的 SPDY

DecoderException(或一个子类)。\n实现 Memcached 编码器\n本节我们将简要介绍编码器的实现。正如我们提到的,编码器负责编码消息为字节序列。这些字节可以通过网络发送到远端。为了发送请求，我们首先创建 MemcachedRequest 类,稍后编码器实现会编码为一系列字节。下面的清单显示了我们的 MemcachedRequest 类\nListing 14.1

response statuses\npublic class Status {\n    public static final short NO_ERROR = 0x0000;\n    public static final short KEY_NOT_FOUND = 0x0001;\n    public static final short KEY_EXISTS = 0x0002;\n

过去不同的版本中使用的线程模型。你会更好的理解不同的线程模型的所有利弊。\n一个线程模型指定代码执行,给开发人员如何执行他们代码的信息。这很重要,因为它允许开发人员事先知道如何保护他们的代码免受并发执行的副作用。若没有这个知识背景，即使是最好的开发人员都只能是碰运气,希望到最后都能这么幸运,但这几乎是不可能的。进入更多的细节之前,提供一个更好的理解主题的回顾这些天大多数应用程序做什么。\n大多数现代应用程序使用多个线程调度工作,因此让应用程序使用所有可用的系统资源以有效的方式。这使得很多有意义,因为大部分硬件有不止一个甚至多个CPU核心。如果一切都只有一个 Thread 执行,不可能完全使用所提供的资源。为了解决这个问题,许多应用程序执行多个 Thread 的运行代码。在早期的 Java,这样做是通过简单地按需创建新 Thread 时,并行工作需要做。\n但很快就发现,这不是完美的,因为创建 Thread 和回收会给他们带来的开销。在 Java 5 中,我们终于有了所谓的线程池,经常缓存 Thread,用来消除创建和回收 Thread 的开销。这些池由 Executor 接口提供。Java 5 提供了许多有用的实现,在其内部发生显著的变化,但思想都一脉相承的。创建 Thread 和重用他们提交一个任务时执行。这可以帮助创建和回收线程的开销降到最低。\n下图显示使用一个线程池执行一个任务，提交一个任务后会使用线程池中空闲的线程来执行，完成任务后释放线程并将线程重新放回线程池：\n\n\nRunnable 表示要执行的任务。这可能是任何东西,从一个数据库调用文件系统清理。\n之前 runnable 移交到线程池。\n闲置的线程被用来执行任务。当一个线程运行结束之后,它将回到闲置线程的列表新任务需要运行时被重用。\n线程执行任务\n\nFigure 15.1 Executor execution logic\n这个修复 Thread 创建和回收的开销,不需要每个新任务创建和销毁新的 Thread 。\n但使用多个 Thread 提供了资源和管理成本,作为一个副作用,引入了太多的上下文切换。这种会随着运行的线程的数量和任务执行的数量的增加而恶化。尽管使用多个线程在开始时似乎不是一个问题,但一旦你把真正工作负载放在系统上，可以会遭受到重击。\n除了这些技术的限制和问题,其他问题可能发生在相关的维护应用程序/框架在未来或在项目的生命周期里。有效地说,增加应用程序的复杂性取决于对比。当状态简单时,写一个多线程应用程序是一个辛苦的工作!你能解决这个问题吗?在实际的场景中需要多个 Thread 规模;这是一个事实。让我们看看 Netty 是解决这个问题。\n"},"ADVANCED TOPICS/The EventLoop.html":{"url":"ADVANCED TOPICS/The EventLoop.html","title":"EventLoop","keywords":"","body":"EventLoop\n事件循环所做的正如它的名字所说的。它运行在一个循环里,直到它的终止。这符合网络框架的设计,因为他们需要在一个循环为一个特定的连接运行事件。这不是 Netty 发明新的东西;其他框架和实现已经这样做了。\n下面的清单显示了典型的 EventLoop 逻辑。请注意这是为了更好的说明这个想法而不是单单展示 Netty 实现本身。\nListing 14.1 Execute task in EventLoop\nwhile (!terminated) {\n    List readyEvents = blockUntilEventsReady(); //1\n    for (Runnable ev: readyEvents) {\n        ev.run(); //2\n    }\n}\n\n阻塞直到事件可以运行\n循环所有事件，并运行他们\n\n在 Netty 中使用 EventLoop 接口代表事件循环，EventLoop 是从EventExecutor 和 ScheduledExecutorService 扩展而来，所以可以将任务直接交给 EventLoop 执行。类关系图如下：\n\nFigure 15.2 EventLoop class hierarchy\nEventLoop 是完全由一个 Thread,从未改变。为了更合理利用资源,根据配置和可用的内核， Netty 可以使用多个 EventLoop。\n事件/任务执行顺序\n一个重要的细节关于事件和任务的执行顺序是,事件/任务执行顺序按照FIFO(先进先出)。这是必要的,因为否则事件不能按顺序处理,所处理的字节将不能保证正确的顺序。这将导致问题,所以这个不是所允许的设计。\nNetty 4 中的 I/O 和事件处理\nNetty 使用 I/O 事件,b被各种 I/O 操作运输本身所触发。\n这些 I/O 操作，例如网络 API 的一部分，由Java 和底层操作系统提供。\n一个区别在于,一些操作(或者事件)是由 Netty 的本身的传输实现触发的，一些是由用户自己。例如读事件通常是由传输本身在读取一些数据时触发。相比之下,写事件通常是由用户本身,例如,当调用 Channel.write(…)。\n究竟需要做一次处理一个事件取决于事件的性质。经常会读网络栈的数据转移到您的应用程序。有时它会在另一个方向做同样的事情,例如,把数据从应用程序到网络堆栈(内核)发送到它的远端。但不限于这种类型的事务;重要的是,所使用的逻辑是通用的,灵活地处理各种各样的用例。\nI/O 和事件处理的一个重要的事情在 Netty 4,是每一个 I/O 操作和事件总是由 EventLoop 本身处理,以及分配给 EventLoop 的 Thread。\n我们应该注意,Netty 不总是使用我们描述的线程模型(通过 EventLoop 抽象)。在下一节中,你会了解 Netty 3 中使用的线程模型。这将帮助你理解为什么现在用新的线程模型以及为什么使用取代了 Netty 3 中仍然使用的旧模式。\nNetty 3 中的 I/O 操作\n在以前的版本中,线程模型是不同的。Netty 保证只将入站(以前称为 upstream)事件在执行 I/O Thread 执行 (I/O Thread 现在在 Netty 4 叫 EventLoop )。所有的出站(以前称为 downstream)事件被调用Thread 处理,这可能是 I/O  Thread 也可以能是其他 Thread。\n这听起来像一个好主意,但原来是容易出错,因为处理 ChannelHandler需要小心的出站事件同步,因为它没有保证只有一个线程运行在同一时间。这可能会发生如果你触发 downstream 事件同时在一个管道时;例如,您 调用 Channel.write(..) 在不同的线程。\n除了需要负担同步 ChannelHandler，这个线程模型的另一个问题是你可能需要去掉一个入站事件作为一个出站事件的结果，例如 Channel.write(..) 操作导致异常。在这种情况下，exceptionCaught 必须生成并抛出去。乍看之下这不像是一个问题，但我们知道， exceptionCaught 由入站事件涉及，会让你知道问题出在哪里。问题是，事实上，你现在的情况是在调用 Thread 上执行，但 exceptionCaught 事件必须交给工作线程来执行，这样上下文切换是必须的。\n相比之下,Netty 4 新线程模型根本没有这些问题,因为一切都在同一个EventLoop 在同一 Thread 中 执行。这消除了需要同步ChannelHandler ,并且使它更容易为用户理解执行。\n现在你知道 EventLoop 如何执行任务,它的时间来快速浏览下 Netty 的各种内部功能。\nNetty 线程模型的内部\nNetty 的内部实现使其线程模型表现优异，它会检查正在执行的 Thread 是否是已分配给实际 Channel (和 EventLoop)，在 Channel 的生命周期内，EventLoop 负责处理所有的事件。\n如果 Thread 是相同的 EventLoop 中的一个，讨论的代码块被执行；如果线程不同，它安排一个任务并在一个内部队列后执行。通常是通过EventLoop 的 Channel 只执行一次下一个事件，这允许直接从任何线程与通道交互，同时还确保所有的 ChannelHandler 是线程安全，不需要担心并发访问问题。\n下图显示在 EventLoop 中调度任务执行逻辑，这适合 Netty 的线程模型：\n\n\n应在 EventLoop 中执行的任务\n任务传递到执行方法后,执行检查来检测调用线程是否是与分配给 EventLoop 是一样的\n线程是一样的,说明你在 EventLoop 里，这意味着可以直接执行的任务\n线程与 EventLoop 分配的不一样。当 EventLoop 事件执行时，队列的任务再次执行一次\n\n15.5 EventLoop execution logic/flow\n设计是非常重要的，以确保不要把任何长时间运行的任务放在执行队列中，因为长时间运行的任务会阻止其他在相同线程上执行的任务。这多少会影响整个系统依赖于 EventLoop 实现用于特殊传输的实现。\n传输之间的切换在你的代码库中可能没有任何改变，重要的是：切勿阻塞 I/O 线程。如果你必须做阻塞调用(或执行需要长时间才能完成的任务)，使用 EventExecutor。\n下一节将讲解一个在应用程序中经常使用的功能，就是调度执行任务(定期执行)。Java对这个需求提供了解决方案，但 Netty 提供了几个更好的方案\n"},"ADVANCED TOPICS/Scheduling tasks for later execution.html":{"url":"ADVANCED TOPICS/Scheduling tasks for

ScheduledExecutorService 工作的很好，但是有局限性，比如在一个额外的线程中执行任务。如果需要执行很多任务，资源使用就会很严重；对于像 Netty 这样的高性能的网络框架来说，严重的资源使用是不能接受的。Netty 对这个问题提供了很好的方法。\nNetty 允许使用 EventLoop 调度任务分配到通道，如下面代码：\nListing 15.5 Schedule task

被取消\n调度任务60秒运行\n\n取消操作，可以使用 ScheduledFuture 返回每个异步操作。 ScheduledFuture 提供一个方法用于取消一个调度了的任务或者检查它的状态。一个简单的取消操作如下：\nScheduledFuture future = ch.eventLoop()\n.scheduleAtFixedRate(..); //1\n// Some other code that runs...\nfuture.cancel(false); //2\n\n调度任务并获取返回的 ScheduledFuture\n取消任务，阻止它再次运行\n\n调度的内部实现\nNetty 内部实现其实是基于George Varghese 提出的 “Hashed  and  hierarchical  timing wheels: Data structures  to efficiently implement timer facility(散列和分层定时轮：数据结构有效实现定时器)”。这种实现只保证一个近似执行，也就是说任务的执行可能不是100%准确；在实践中，这已经被证明是一个可容忍的限制，不影响多数应用程序。所以，定时执行任务不可能100%准确的按时执行。\n为了更好的理解它是如何工作，我们可以这样认为：\n\n在指定的延迟时间后调度任务；\n任务被插入到 EventLoop 的 Schedule-Task-Queue(调度任务队列)；\n如果任务需要马上执行，EventLoop 检查每个运行；\n如果有一个任务要执行，EventLoop 将立刻执行它，并从队列中删除；\nEventLoop 等待下一次运行，从第4步开始一遍又一遍的重复。\n\n因为这样的实现计划执行不可能100%正确，对于多数用例不可能100%准备的执行计划任务；在 Netty 中，这样的工作几乎没有资源开销。\n但是如果需要更准确的执行呢？很容易，你需要使用ScheduledExecutorService 的另一个实现，这不是 Netty 的内容。记住，如果不遵循 Netty 的线程模型协议，你将需要自己同步并发访问。\n"},"ADVANCED TOPICS/IO EventLoop Thread allocation in

在它的生命周期里和同样的线程。你可以,也应该,依靠这个,因为它可以确保你不需要担心同步(包括线程安全、可见性和同步)在你 ChannelHandler实现。\n但是这也会影响使用 ThreadLocal,例如,经常使用的应用程序。因为一个EventLoop 通常影响多个 Channel,ThreadLocal 将相同的 Channel 分配给 EventLoop。因此,它适合状态跟踪等等。它仍然可以用于共享重或昂贵的对象之间的 Channel ,不再需要保持状态,因此它可以用于每个事件,而不需要依赖于先前 ThreadLocal 的状态。\nEventLoop 和 Channel\n我们应该注意,在 Netty 4 , Channel 可能从 EventLoop 注销稍后又从不同 EventLoop
